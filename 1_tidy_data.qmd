# Intro to Tidy data

Tidy data is data where:

1.  Each variable is a column; each column is a variable.

2.  Each observation is a row; each row is an observation.

3.  Each value is a cell; each cell is a single value.

Tidy data describes a standard way of storing data that is used wherever possible throughout the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). If you ensure that your data is tidy, you'll spend less time fighting with the tools and more time working on your analysis.
