NA,July,To Participants of the Orthodox-Catholic Ecumenical Pilgrimage from the United States of America (17 July 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/july/documents/20250717-pellegrinaggio-ecumenico-usa.html,"ADDRESS OF POPE LEO XIVTO PARTICIPANTS OF THE ORTHODOX-CATHOLIC ECUMENICAL PILGRIMAGEFROM THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Castel GandolfoThursday, 17 July 2025 [Multimedia] ___________ Mydear brothers and sisters, I offer a cordial greeting to all of you, especially toMetropolitan Elpidophoros and Cardinal Tobin and I thank them for arranging this meeting as part of your pilgrimage. You are all very welcome. I am sorry that I am a little bit late. Several meetings were scheduled this morning. But I am very happy to have this moment to spend with you in this beautiful place, Castel Gandolfo. You have set out from the United States, which as you know, is alsomy native country, and this journey is meant to be a return to the roots,the sources, the places, the memorials of the Apostles Peter and Paul in Rome, and of the Apostle Andrew in Constantinople. It is also a way to experience anew and in a concrete way the faith that comes from listening to the Gospel,hearing the Gospel handed down to us by the Apostles (cf.Rom10:16). It is significant that your pilgrimage is taking place this year, in which we celebrate one thousand seven hundred years of the Council of Nicaea. The Symbol of Faith adopted by the assembled Fathers remains – together with the additions made at the Council of Constantinople in 381 – the common patrimony of all Christians, for many of whom the Creed is an integral part of their liturgical celebrations. Then too, by a providential coincidence, this year the two calendars in use in our Churches coincide, with the result that we were able to chant as one the Easter Alleluia: “Christ is risen! He is truly risen!” Those words proclaim that the darkness of sin and death have been vanquished by the Lamb that was slain, Jesus Christ our Lord. This inspires us with great hope, for we know that no cry of the innocent victims of violence, no lament of mothers mourning their children will go unheard. Our hope is in God, yet precisely because we constantly draw from the inexhaustible source of his grace, we are called to be witnesses and bearers of hope. The Catholic Church is presently celebrating ourJubilee year whose motto, chosen by my predecessorPope Francis, is“Peregrinantes in Spe”, that is, pilgrims in hope. Your Eminence, Metropolitan Elpidophoros, your very name tells us that you are a bearer of hope! It is my hope that your pilgrimage will confirm all of you in the hope born of our faith in the risen Lord! Here in Rome, you have spent time in prayer at the tombs of Peter and Paul. As you now visit the See of Constantinople, I wouldask you to bring greetings and my embrace, an embrace of peace, to my venerable brother Patriarch Bartholomew, who so kindly attended the Holy Mass for the inauguration of my pontificate. I hope to be able to meet you again, in a few months, to take part in the ecumenical commemoration of the anniversary of the Council of Nicaea. Your pilgrimage is one of the abundant fruits of the ecumenical movement aimed at restoring full unity among all Christ’s disciples in accordance with the Lord’s prayer at the Last Supper, when Jesus said, “that they may all be one” (Jn17:21). At times, we take for granted these signs of sharing and fellowship that, albeit not yet signifying full unity, already manifest the theological progress and the dialogue of charity that have marked recent decades. On December 7th,1965, on the eve of the conclusion of theSecond Vatican Council, my predecessorSaint Paul VIand the Patriarch, Athenagoras signed aJoint Declarationremoving from memory and the midst of the Church the sentences of excommunication that followed the events of the year1054. Before then, a pilgrimage like your own would probably not even have been possible. The work of the Holy Spirit created in hearts the readiness to take those steps as a prophetic presage of full and visible unity. For our part, we too must continue to implore from the Paraclete, the Consoler, the grace to pursue the path of unity and fraternal charity. Unity among those who believe in Christ is one of the signs of God’s gift of consolation; Scripture promises that “in Jerusalem you will be comforted” (Is66:13). Rome, Constantinople and all the other Sees, are not called to vie for primacy, lest we risk finding ourselves like the disciples who along the way, even as Jesus was announcing his coming passion, argued about which of them was the greatest (cf.Mk9:33-37). In his Bull of Indiction for the Jubilee Year,Pope Francisnoted that “the Holy Year will also guide our steps towards yet another fundamental celebration for all Christians: 2033 will mark the two thousandth anniversary of the redemption won by the passion, death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus” (Spes Non Confundit, 6). Spiritually, all of us need to return to Jerusalem, the City of Peace, where Peter, Andrew and all the Apostles, after the days of the Lord’s passion and resurrection, received the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, and from there bore witness to Christ to the ends of the earth. May our return to the roots of our faith make all of us experience the gift of God’s consolation and make us capable, like the Good Samaritan, of pouring out the oil of consolation and the wine of gladness on today’s humanity. Thank you. Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"

Peace be with you. Welcome to you all! Let us sit down and reflect together a little. Dear brothers and sisters, I welcome you with joy on the occasion of your Chapters and Assemblies. I greet the Superiors General, the members of the Councils, and all of you. You have gathered to pray, to discuss and to reflect together on what the Lord asks of you for the future. Your Founders and Foundresses, docile to the action of the Holy Spirit, have left you the legacy of various charisms for the edification of the Body of Christ (cf.Eph4:11-12), and it is precisely so that this may grow according to God’s plans that the Church asks of you the service that you are carrying out (cf. Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, DecreePerfectae caritatis, 4). Your respective Institutes embody complementary aspects of the life and action of all the People of God: the offering of self in union with the Sacrifice of Christ, the missionad gentes, love for the Church preserved and transmitted, the education and formation of the young. These are different ways in which the one and eternal reality that animates them all is expressed in charismatic form: God's love for humanity. As is customary, then, each of your Congregations identified particular angles, in the light of which to reinterpret the legacy received, in order to update and modernize its contents. These pathways of work, which you chose during the time of preparation, in prayer and mutual listening, are also a precious gift insofar as they are the fruit of the Spirit. It is He who, through the contribution of many, under the guidance of the Pastors, “helps the Christian community to advance in charity towards the fullness of truth (cf.Jn16:13)” (Benedict XVI,Homily at the Holy Mass for the Inauguration of the Fifth General Conference of the Bishops of Latin America and the Caribbean, 13 May 2007). You have thus formulated guidelines that contain fundamental calls: to renew an authentic missionary spirit, to make one's own the attitude “that is also yours in Christ Jesus” (cf.Phil2:5), to promote peace, to cultivate pastoral co-responsibility in local churches, and so on. To stay by their side and to remember them together, at this time, helps us to grasp the richness of our being in a community, especially as men and women religious, engaged in the same wonderful adventure of “[following] Christ more nearly” (Catechism of the Catholic Church, 916). May this renew and confirm in all of us the awareness and the joy of being Church, and in particular spur you, in your discernment in the Chapters, to think on a large scale, as unique pieces of a plan that exceeds you and involves you beyond your own expectations: the plan of salvation with which God wants to bring all of humanity back to himself, as one big family (cf. Francis,General Audience, 29 May 2013). This is the spirit in which your Institutes were born, and this is the perspective in which to place every effort, so that it may contribute, through small lights, to spreading over the whole earth the light of Christ, which never dims (cf. Roman Missal,Easter Precony). Dear friends, let us ask the Lord together to be docile to the voice of his Spirit, who “teaches everything” (cf.Jn14:26), and without whose help, in our weakness, we do not even know how to ask as we ought (cf.Rom8:26). Thank you for your work and for your faithful presence in so many parts of the world. I bless you from my heart, and I pray for you. Thank you! Let us pray together: [Our Father] [Blessing] Thank you all! __________________ Daily Bulletin of the Holy See Press Office, 12 July 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"

Dear sisters, I am pleased to meet you at the end of your provincial Chapter: in this week of prayer, discernment and joint planning, you have been able to renew your adhesion to the charism of your foundress, the venerable Sister Maria Teresa Spinelli. While the process of her canonization continues, your journey of holiness proceeds too! As Augustinian Sisters, Servants of Jesus and Mary, I encourage you to let yourselves be guided anew by the name you bear. Indeed, the service you carry out every day is realized first and foremost in the consecration of life to the Lord, and is strengthened in sincere devotion to his and our Mother. By imitating Sister Maria Teresa, you will therefore be patient in tribulations, because it is precisely in our trials that the Lord confirms his faithfulness; you will be courageous in the mission, so that the educational work to which you dedicate yourselves may form wise minds and hearts capable of listening and of passion for humanity; you will be unwavering in the following of Christ, who is “the way, the truth and the life” (Jn14:6), and therefore the criterion for all our cultural initiatives. We know that a culture without truth becomes an instrument of the powerful: instead of freeing consciences, it confuses and distracts them according to the interests of the market, fashion or worldly success. In this regard, I advise you to pick up again a work by the holy Doctor, our father Augustine,De Magistro, to contemplate it in the near future, as you gather the fruits of your Chapter. In this work, Augustine affirms that external teaching must always lead to the encounter with the inner Master, who is Jesus (cf. I, 11). In his name, I wish all the best to your communities, and I wholeheartedly impart the apostolic blessing to you. Thank you! ____________ Daily Bulletin of the Holy See Press Office, 5 July 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,July,"To Teachers of Catholic Schools in Ireland, England, Wales, and Scotland; and to the Young People of the Diocese of Copenhagen (5 July 2025)",NA,"GREETING OF HIS HOLINESS POPE LEO XIVTO PILGRIMS FROM DENMARK, IRELAND, ENGLAND, WALES AND SCOTLAND Clementine HallSaturday, 5 July 2025 [Multimedia] ____________________________________ In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Peace be with you! Good morning and welcome to the Vatican. Your Excellencies,Dear priests and young friends, I am pleased to greet all of you on the occasion of your pilgrimage to Rome during this Jubilee Year, which as you know is focused on the theological virtue of hope. In particular, I welcome the young people from the Diocese of Copenhagen, which isthisgroup, together with the teachers from Ireland, England, Wales and Scotland. You are following in the footsteps of countless pilgrims from your various countries, who for centuries have been making this same pilgrimage to Rome, to the “Eternal City”. Indeed, Rome has always been a special home for Christians, since it is the place where the Apostles Peter and Paul gave the supreme witness to their love for Jesus by offering their lives as martyrs. As the Successor of Peter, I wish to express my gratitude for your presence here, and I pray that by visiting the various holy sites you may draw inspiration and hope from the profound example of how the saints and martyrs imitated Christ. A pilgrimage has a vital part to play in our life of faith, for it removes us from our homes and our daily routines, and gives us time and space to encounter God more deeply. Such moments always help us to grow, for through them the Holy Spirit gently fashions us to be ever more closely conformed to the mind and the heart of Jesus Christ. In a particular way, dear brothers and sisters, young people gathered with us this morning, remember that God has created each one of you with a purpose and a mission in this life. Use this opportunity for listening, for prayer, so that you may hear more clearly God’s voice calling you deep within your hearts. I would add that today, so often, we lose the ability to listen, to really listen. We listen to music, we have our ears flooded constantly with all kinds of digital input, but sometimes we forget to listen to our own hearts and it’s in our hearts that God speaks to us, that God calls us and invites us to know him better and to live in his love. And through that listening you might be open to allowing God’s grace to strengthen your faith in Jesus (cf.Col2:7), so that you might more readily share that gift with others. And addressing you, dear teachers: what I have just said to the young people applies equally to you, especially given your important role in the formation of today’s youth: children, teenagers, young adults. For they will look up to you as models: models in life, models of faith. They’ll look to you particularly as tohowyou teach and how you live. I hope that, each day, you will nurture your relationship with Christ, who gives us the pattern of all authentic teaching (cfMt7:28), so that, in turn, you may guide and encourage those entrusted to your care to follow Christ in their own lives. And finally, when all of you return home, please remember that a pilgrimage does not end, it shifts its focus to the daily “pilgrimage of discipleship”. We are all pilgrims and we are always pilgrims, walking as we seek to follow the Lord, and as we seek the path that is truly ours in life. That’s certainly not easy, but with the help of the Lord, the intercession of the saints, and by encouraging one another, you can be certain that, as long as you remain faithful, trusting always in God’s mercy, the experience of this pilgrimage will continue to bear fruit throughout your lives (cf.Jn15:16). Dear friends, with these few words, and entrusting you to the intercession of Mary, Mother of the Church, I gladly impart to each of you my heartfelt blessing. God bless you and thank you.

Dear Sisters, good morning and welcome! I am pleased to meet with you. For some of you it is the occasion of your General Chapter, others are here for your Jubilee pilgrimage. In both cases, you have come to the tomb of Peter in order to renew your love for the Lord and your fidelity to the Church. You belong to Congregations that were founded at different times and in distinct circumstances: Sisters of the Order of Saint Basil the Great; Daughters of Divine Charity; Augustinian Sisters of Amparo; Franciscan Sisters of the Sacred Hearts. Yet your histories share a common thread that can be seen in the light of such great historical witnesses to the spiritual life as Augustine, Basil and Francis, whose asceticism, courage and holiness of life inspired your founders to foster new ways of serving others. This is evident especially in your care for the weakest: children, poor girls and boys, orphans, migrants, and more recently for the elderly and the sick as well as many other ministries of charity. Your response to the challenges of the past and the vitality of your present make clear that fidelity to the ancient wisdom of the Gospel is the best way forward for those who, led by the Holy Spirit, undertake new paths of self-giving, dedicated to loving God and neighbor and listening attentively to the signs of the times (cf. SECOND VATICAN ECUMENICAL COUNCIL, Pastoral ConstitutionGaudium et Spes, 4; 11). With this in mind, theSecond Vatican Council, referring to religious institutes dedicated to works of charity, emphasized how important it is that in them “the entire religious life of the members should be imbued with an apostolic spirit, and all their apostolic activity with a religious spirit,” so that they “may first answer their call to follow Christ and to serve Christ himself in his members... in intimate union with him” (DecreePerfectae Caritatis, 8). Saint Augustine, speaking of the primacy of God in the Christian life, affirms that, “God is your everything. If you are hungry, God is your bread; if you are thirsty, God is your water; if you are in darkness, God is your light that never fades; if you are naked, God is your everlasting garment” (In Ioannis Evangelium, 13, 5). Indeed, we would do well to ask ourselves: to what extent are these words true for me? How much does the Lord satisfy my thirst for life, love or light? These are important questions. Moreover, this rootedness in Christ is what led those who went before us – men and women like us, with gifts and limitations like ours – to do things they perhaps never thought they could achieve. This rootedness enabled them to sow seeds of goodness that, enduring throughout the centuries and across continents, have now reached practically the entire world, as your presence here demonstrates. As I mentioned, some of you are engaged in your General Chapters, others are here for the Jubilee. In any case, you are faced with important choices that will determine your future, that of your sisters and of the Church herself. For this reason, it seems most appropriate to conclude by reiterating, for all of us, the beautiful hope expressed by Saint Paul in addressing the Christians of Ephesus: I pray that “Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded in love. I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God” (Eph3:17-19). Thank you for your work and your fidelity. May the Blessed Virgin Mary accompany you. And I give you my blessing. Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,June,To Pilgrims of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church (28 June 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/june/documents/20250628-chiesa-greco-cattolica-ucraina.html,"ADDRESS OF THE HOLY FATHER LEO XIVTO PILGRIMS OF THE UKRAINIAN GREEK-CATHOLIC CHURCH St. Peter's BasilicaSaturday, 28 June 2025 [Multimedia] __________ In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Peace be with you. Dear brothers in the Episcopate,Dear priests, women and men religious,Dear sisters, dear brothers! I cordially greet you, dear faithful of the Greek-Catholic Ukrainian Church, who have come to the tomb of the Apostle Peter on the occasion of the Jubilee year. I greet His Beatitude Shevchuk, major archbishop of Kyiv-Halyč, the bishops, the priests, consecrated women and men, and all the lay faithful. Your pilgrimage is a sign of the desire to renew the faith, to strengthen the bond and the communion with the Bishop of Rome, and to bear witness to the hope that does not disappoint, since it is born from the love of Christ that was poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit (cf.Rm5:5). The Jubilee calls us to become pilgrims of this hope in our entire life, despite the adversities of the current moment. The journey to Rome, with the passage through the Holy Doors and the visits to the tombs of the Apostles and the Martyrs, is the symbol of this daily journey, striving towards eternity, where the Lord will dry every tear and there will be no more death, no more mourning, no more sorrow, no more pain (cf.Rev21:4). Many of you, in order to arrive here, departed from your beautiful land, rich in Christian faith, rendered fruitful by the evangelical witness of so many saints, and irrigated with the blood of many martyrs, who throughout the centuries, with the gift of their life, sealed their fidelity to the Apostle Peter and his Successors. Faith, dear friends, is a treasure to be shared. Every time brings with it difficulties, hardships and challenges, but also opportunities to grow in trust and in surrender to God. The faith of your people is now being sorely tested. Many of you, since the large-scale invasion of Ukraine began, have surely asked: Lord, why all this? Where are you? What must we do to save our families, our homes and our homeland? To believe does not mean to have all the answers, but to trust that God is with us and gives us His grace, that He will have the last word, and life will conquer death. The Virgin Mary, so dear to the Ukrainian people, with her humble and courageous “yes”, opened the door to the redemption of the world; she assures us that our “yes”, simple and sincere, can also become a tool in God’s hands, to realize something great. Confirmed in faith by the Successor of Peter, I urge you to share it with your loved ones, your compatriots and all those whom the Lord will lead you to meet. To say “yes” today can enable new horizons of faith, hope and peace to be opened up, especially to all those who are suffering. Sisters and brothers, as I meet you here, I would like to express my closeness to tormented Ukraine, to the children, the young people, the elderly and, in a special way, to the families who mourn their loved ones. I share your sorrow for the prisoners and victims of this senseless war. I entrust to the Lord your intentions, your daily hardships and tragedies, and above all, the desires for peace and serenity. I encourage you to walk together, pastors and faithful, keeping your eyes fixed on Jesus, our salvation. May the Virgin Mary, who precisely because of her union with the passion of her Son is Mother of Hope, guide and protect you. I bless all of you, your families, your Church and your people, from my heart. Thank you. ___________________ Daily Bulletin of the Holy See Press Office, 28 June 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"

Peace be with you!First of all, welcome, good morning to you all! I greet the Abbot General, who has been newly elected, and I thank all of you for the gift that your monastic life represents, recalling the entire Church to the primacy of God as the source of joy and the basis of personal and social transformation. As at the beginning of your history, when Saint John Gualbert obeyed the vocation that impelled him to greater authenticity, we again find ourselves at the dawn of a new millennium in which, amid many fears, the entire world seems to be reshaping itself. It is not a question of abandoning the challenges of our time, but of dwelling within them with the depth of those who are silent and listen to the Word of God, so as to bring it to light in a changing culture. The fragility of those beginnings can inspire and console the present fragilities. We are often less strong than in the past, less young, less numerous, at times harmed by human limitations and mistakes, but the Gospel welcomedsine glossawill never cease to spread the fragrance of its beauty. Let nothing hold you back from the original need to reform, renew and simplify, to the benefit of everyone, that Christian life that is still able to broaden the horizons and the breath of every human existence. As early as 1973,Saint Paul VIrecalled your Founder and the Congregation’s first steps in this way: “He wanted a ‘novum institutum’ that would return to the genuine sources of prayer and the apostolate, as the Apostles, the Fathers of the Church, and his Saint Benedict had done; and the first friars, who gathered around him in Vallombrosa, indeed sought and found that ‘nova conversio’, which was felt as a wellspring of personal sanctification, but which would likewise prove to be a leaven of new life”[1]. Pope Montini – who knows, perhaps many of you were young monks at that time… I see that some of you are very young though! – insisted on the current relevance of those beginnings, observing that “the renewal of religious orders, and of the Church in general, in the clergy and in the laity, are the most lively and impassioned points of the Council and post-Council period”[2]. My beloved predecessor,Pope Francis, tirelessly urged all of us to continue the renewal of the Church promoted byVatican Council II. We are still asked to overcome self-referentiality, to be poorer and to listen to the poor, to intensify the bonds of communion. In particular, may communion with the other Congregations of the daughters and sons of Saint Benedict help you to remain faithful to the Rule, in dialogue with the contemporary world. Indeed, the quest for a spirituality in which prayer, work and joy intertwine in fidelity to everyday places and things, is always new. Be attentive and hospitable witnesses to it. I encourage you to look forward with hope, with an affectionate thought also for all your confrères, while I impart to you my heartfelt Apostolic Blessing. Thank you!____________________________ [1]Paul VI,Address to the General Council of the Benedictine Congregation of Vallombrosa, 28 March 1973.

After centuries of disagreements and misunderstanding, the resumption of genuine dialogue between the sister Churches of Rome and Constantinople was made possible through courageous and farsighted steps taken byPope Paul VIand Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras. Their venerable successors to the Sees of Rome and Constantinople have pursued with conviction the same path of reconciliation, thus further strengthening our close relations. Here I would like to mention the witness of sincere closeness to the Catholic Church given by the Ecumenical Patriarch, His All Holiness Bartholomew, by his personal participation in the funeral of the late Pope Francis, and again at the Mass inaugurating my Pontificate. As I think back with gratitude on the progress made thus far, I assure you of my desire to persevere in the effort to restore full visible communion between our Churches. The attainment of this goal can only come about, with God’s help, through a continued commitment to respectful listening and fraternal dialogue. For this reason, I am open to any suggestions that you may offer in this regard, always in consultation with my brother Bishops of the Catholic Church who, each in his own way, share with me the responsibility for the complete and visible unity of the Church (cf. Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, Dogmatic ConstitutionLumen Gentium, 23). Your Eminences, dear brothers in Christ, I thank you most heartily for your presence in Rome on this solemn occasion. I ask you kindly to convey my cordial greetings to Patriarch Bartholomew and the members of the Holy Synod, together with my gratitude for sending a Delegation again this year. May Saints Peter and Paul, Saint Andrew and the Holy Mother of God, who live eternally in the perfect communion of the saints, accompany and sustain us in our efforts in the service of the Gospel. Thank you!

2025,June,To Participants in the Meeting of Priests promoted by the Dicastery for the Clergy (26 June 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/june/documents/20250626-incontro-dicastero-clero.html,"ADDRESS OF POPE LEO XIVTO PARTICIPANTS IN THE MEETING OF PRIESTSPROMOTED BY THEDICASTERY FOR THE CLERGY Auditorium of Via della Conciliazione, RomeThursday, 26 June 2025 [Multimedia] __________ Let us begin with the Sign of the Cross, since we are all here because Christ, who died and rose again, has given us life and called us to serve. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Peace be with you! Dear brothers in the priesthood, dear brother priests,Dear formators, seminarians, vocation directors, friends in the Lord! It is a source of great joy for me to be here with you today. In the heart of this Holy Year, we want to bear witness together that we can be joyful priests because Christ has called us, and Christ has made us his friends (cf.Jn15:15). This is a grace that we want to accept with gratitude and responsibility. I would like to thank Cardinal Lazzaro and the staff of theDicastery for the Clergyfor their generous and competent service. Theirs is an extensive and important work, often carried out in silence and with discretion, which produces rich fruits of communion, formation and renewal. This occasion of fraternal sharing by priests from many nations can enable us to profit from a wealth of practical experiences and thus promote creativity, co-responsibility and communion in the Church. In this way, the seeds sown with great effort in many different communities can become a source of light and encouragement for everyone. Jesus’ words, “I have called you friends” (Jn15:15), are not just an expression of the affection he felt for his disciples, but a real key to the meaning of our priestly ministry. The priest is a friend of the Lord, called to a personal and trusting relationship with him, nourished by the word, the celebration of the sacraments, and daily prayer. Friendship with Christ is the spiritual foundation of the ordained ministry, the ultimate reason for our celibacy and the source of our daily commitment to the service of the ecclesial community. It sustains us in times of trial and enables us to renew each day the “yes” we said to the Lord at the beginning of our vocation. Based on those words of Jesus, I would like, dear friends, to draw three particular implications for the training of future priests. First,formation is a process of growth in relationship. To become friends of Christ involves training in how to relate to others, not merely the acquisition of practical skills. Priestly formation is about more than learning concepts alone; it is a journey of growth in intimacy with the Lord. It engages the entire person – heart, mind and freedom – in order to shape him in the image of the Good Shepherd. Only those who live as friends of Christ, and are imbued with his Spirit, can preach with conviction, console with compassion and lead with wisdom. This includes learning to listen patiently to others, meditative prayer, and the cultivation of a rich and rightly ordered inner life. Second,fraternity is an essential element of priestly life. Becoming friends of Christ entails living as brothers with our fellow priests and with our bishops, not as competitors or in an individualistic way. Formation should help forge solid bonds within the presbyterate as an expression of a synodal Church in which all of us grow together in sharing the labours and joys of ministry. For how could we, as ministers, be builders of living communities, unless we first experience a genuine spirit of fraternity among ourselves? Finally,forming priests who are friends of Christ means forming men, men who are capable of loving, listening, praying and serving together. That is why special attention should be given to training seminary formators, because the effectiveness of their work depends primarily on the example of life and communion that they themselves give. The fact that seminaries exist is a reminder that the formation of future ordained ministers cannot be carried out in isolation. It demands the involvement of all those friends of the Lord who live as missionary disciples in the service of the People of God. Here, I would also like to add a word about vocations. Despite the signs of a crisis in the life and mission of priests, God continues to call, and he remains faithful to his promises. Yet there need to be adequate spaces where his voice can be heard. There is a need for settings and forms of youth ministry centred on the Gospel, for this is where the call to total gift of self can emerge and mature. Do not be afraid to present young people with demanding and liberating possibilities for their future! As we look to the young men and women who even now are generously responding to the Lord’s call, may all of us feel the desire to renew our “yes,” and to rediscover the beauty of being missionary disciples of Christ the Good Shepherd. Dear friends, we are meeting on the eve of the Solemnity of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus. It is from this “burning bush” that our vocation originates; it is from this source of grace that we want to let ourselves be transformed. Pope Francis’EncyclicalDilexit Nosis a precious gift for the whole Church, but in a special way for us priests. It directly challenges us, for it asks us to combine mysticism and social commitment, contemplation and action, silence and speaking out. The times in which we live also challenge us: many people appear to have drifted away from the faith, yet deep inside, especially in the case of the young, there continues to be a thirst for the infinite and for salvation. If there is a widespread experience of the “absence” of God, it is nonetheless true that every human being is made for him, and the Father’s plan is that Christ be the heart of the world. That is why we want to recover, together, a missionary spirit: a missionary outreach that courageously and lovingly proposes the Gospel of Jesus. Through our pastoral activity, the Lord himself cares for his flock, gathers those who are scattered, tends those who are wounded and supports those who are disheartened. When we imitate the example of the Master, we grow in faith and thus become credible witnesses of the vocation we have received. When someone believes, it shows: the joy of a priest mirrors his closeness to Christ, who sustains him in his mission and ministry. Dear brothers in the priesthood, I thank those of you who have come from far away! I thank each of you for your daily efforts, especially in centers of formation, in existential peripheries and in difficult and at times dangerous places. As we think of all those priests who gave their lives in sacrifice to others, even to the point of shedding their blood, let us now renew our desire to devote ourselves unreservedly to an apostolate of compassion and joy. Thank you for what you are! You remind everyone how good it is to be a priest, and that every call from the Lord is first and foremost a call to share in his joy. We are not perfect, but we are friends of Christ, brothers to one another and sons of his loving Mother Mary, and this is enough for us. Let us now turn to the Lord Jesus, to his merciful Heart, afire with love for every person. Let us implore the grace to be missionary disciples and shepherds as he desires: by seeking those who have gone astray, by serving the poor and by humbly guiding those entrusted to our care. May the Heart of Jesus inspire our projects, transform our hearts, and renew us in our mission. With great affection I give you my blessing and assure all of you of my prayers. * * * * * To conclude, let us take a moment to pray together. A very brief moment, but as I said before, a very important one. I want to stress the importance of the spiritual life of priests. So many times, when we need help, we need to look for a good guide, a spiritual director, a good confessor. None of us here is alone. Even if you are working in the remotest mission, you are never alone! Try to live whatPope Francisliked to call “closeness”: closeness with the Lord, closeness with your bishop or religious superior, and closeness among yourselves, because you really need to be friends and brothers. Cherish the rich experience of walking together in the knowledge that we are called to be disciples of the Lord. We have a great mission and together we can carry it out. Always count on God’s grace and my own closeness; together, we can truly be his voice in the world. Thank you! And so, let us pray together:Our Father... And to Mary our Mother:Hail Mary...

2025,June,To Participants in the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking (26 June 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/june/documents/20250626-giornata-lotta-droga.html,"ADDRESS OF POPE LEO XIVTO PARTICIPANTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL DAYAGAINST DRUG ABUSE AND ILLICIT TRAFFICKING San Damaso courtyardThursday, 26 June 2025 [Multimedia] _____________ Let us begin with the Sign of the Cross: in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Peace be with you! Welcome to you all, and I hope the sun is not too strong… But God is great, and he will accompany us. Thank you for your presence! [Greeting from the Undersecretary of State at the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, Alfredo Mantovano, and testimony from Paola Clericuzio, of the San Patrignano Community] Dear brothers and sisters, good morning and welcome! I thank those who have made this meeting possible, which in many ways brings us to the heart of the Jubilee, a year of grace in which dignity, too often diminished or denied, is recognized to everyone.Hopeis a word rich in history for you: it is not a slogan, but light rediscovered through great work. I would like to repeat to you, then, that greeting that changes the heart: peace be with all of you! On Easter evening, Jesus greeted the disciples closed in the Upper Room in this way. They had abandoned him, they believed they had lost him for ever, they were fearful and disappointed, and some had already gone. It is Jesus, however, who finds them, who comes looking for them again. He enters behind closed doors into the place where they are as if buried alive. He brings peace, he recreates them with forgiveness, he breathes on them: that is, he infuses the Holy Spirit, who is the breath of God in us. When there is no air, when there is no horizon, our dignity withers. Let us not forget that the risen Jesus still comes and brings his breath! He often does so through the people who go beyond our closed doors and who, despite all that may have happened, see the dignity we have forgotten, or that has been denied to us. Dear friends, your presence here is a testimony of freedom. I remember that when Pope Francis used to enter a prison, even on his last Holy Thursday, he always asked himself that question: “Why them and not me?” Drugs and addiction are an invisible prison that you, in different ways, have known and fought, but we are all called to freedom. As I meet you, I think of the abyss of my heart and of every human heart. It is a Psalm, that is, the Bible, that calls the mystery that dwells in us an “abyss” (cf.Ps63:7). Saint Augustine confessed that only in Christ did the restlessness of his heart find peace. We seek peace and joy, we thirst for them. And many deceptions can delude and even imprison us in this quest. Let us look around us, though. And let us read in each other’s faces a word that never betrays:together. We conquer evil together. Joy is found together. Injustice is fought together. The God who created and knows each one of us – and is more intimate to me than I am to myself – made us to be together. Of course, there are also bonds that hurt and human groups where freedom is lacking. But these, too, can only be overcome together, trusting those who do not profit from our suffering, those whom we can meet and who meet us with selfless attention. Today, brothers and sisters, we are engaged in a battle that cannot be abandoned as long as, around us, anyone is still imprisoned in the various forms of addiction. Our fight is against those who make their immense business out of drugs and every other addiction – think of alcohol or gambling. There are huge concentrations of interest and extensive criminal organizations that states have a duty to dismantle. It is easier to fight against their victims. Too often, in the name of security, war is waged against the poor, filling prisons with those who are merely the final link in a chain of death. Those who hold the chain in their hands instead manage to gain influence and impunity. Our cities must not be freed of the marginalized, but of marginalization; they must be cleared not of the desperate, but of desperation. “How beautiful are those cities which overcome paralysing mistrust, integrate those who are different and make this very integration a new factor of development! How attractive are those cities which, even in their architectural design, are full of spaces which connect, relate and favour the recognition of others!” (Francis, Apostolic ExhortationEvangelii Gaudium, 210). The Jubilee indicates the culture of encounter as the way to safety; it asks of us the restitution and redistribution of unjustly accumulated wealth, as the way to personal and civil reconciliation. “As in heaven, so on earth”: the city of God commits us to prophecy in the city of men. And this - we know - can also lead to martyrdom today. The fight against drug trafficking, educational commitment among the poor, the defence of indigenous communities and migrants, and fidelity to the social doctrine of the Church are in many places considered subversive. Dear young people, you are not spectators of the renewal our earth so badly needs: you are protagonists. God does great things with those he frees from evil. Another Psalm, beloved of the early Christians, says: “The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone” (118:22). Jesus was denied and crucified outside the gates of his city. Upon him, the cornerstone on which God rebuilds the world, you too are stones of great value in building a new humanity. Jesus, who was denied, invites all of you, and if you have felt rejected and spent, you are now no more. Your mistakes, your sufferings, but above all your desire for life, make you witnesses that change is possible. The Church needs you. Humanity needs you. Education and politics need you. Together, we will make the infinite dignity imprinted on each person prevail over every degrading addiction. Unfortunately, such dignity sometimes only shines through when it is almost completely lost. Then a shock occurs and it becomes clear that getting back up is a matter of life and death. Well, today the whole of society needs that jolt, it needs your witness and the great work you are doing. Indeed, we all have the vocation to be freer and to be human, the vocation to peace. This is the most divine vocation. Let us go forward together, then, multiplying the places of healing, encounter and education: pastoral paths and social policies that start from the street and never give anyone up for lost. And you, pray too, that my ministry may be at the service of the hope of persons and peoples, at the service of all. I entrust you to the maternal guidance of Mary Most Holy. And I bless you from my heart. Thank you! [Blessing] Many thanks to you all! Always be courageous, and keep going forward!___________________________ Holy See Press Office Bulletin, 26 June 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,June,To Participants in the Plenary Session of the “Reunion of Aid Agencies for the Oriental Churches” (ROACO) (26 June 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/june/documents/20250626-roaco.html,"ADDRESS OF POPE LEO XIVTO PARTICIPANTS IN THE PLENARY SESSIONOF THE “REUNION OF AID AGENCIES FOR THE ORIENTAL CHURCHES” (ROACO) Clementine HallThursday, 26 June 2025 [Multimedia] ___________ In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Peace be with you! Your Eminence, Your Excellencies,Dear priests, brothers and sisters, Peace be with you! I offer you a warm welcome and I am pleased to meet you as you conclude your Plenary Assembly. I greet His Eminence Cardinal Gugerotti, the other Superiors of the Dicastery, the Officials, and all of you, members of the ROACO Agencies. “God loves a cheerful giver” (2Cor9:7). I realize that, for you, supporting the Eastern Churches is not primarily a task, but a mission carried out in the name of the Gospel, which, as the word itself indicates, is aproclamation of joy, which before all else gladdens the heart of God, who never allows himself to be outdone in generosity. I thank you because, together with all your benefactors, you are sowing seeds of hope in the lands of the Christian East, which today, as never before, are devastated by wars, plundered by special interests, and covered by a cloud of hatred that renders the air unbreathable and toxic. You provide a breath of oxygen to the Eastern Churches, so worn down by the conflicts in course. For many people, poor in means but rich in faith, you are a light that shines amid the dark shadows of hatred. I ask you with all my heart to continue to do everything possible to help these Churches, so precious and so greatly afflicted. The history of the Eastern Catholic Churches has often been marked by suffering and violence. Sadly, there have also been instances of oppression and misunderstanding within the Catholic community itself, which at times failed to acknowledge and appreciate the value of traditions other than those of the West. Yet today, violent conflict seems to be raging in the Christian East with a diabolical intensity previously unknown. Your annual meeting has itself been affected by the physical absence of those who were to have come from the Holy Land but proved unable to make the journey. Our hearts bleed when we think of Ukraine, the tragic and inhumane situation in Gaza and the Middle East, ravaged by the spread of war. All of us, by virtue of our humanity, are called upon to examine the causes of these conflicts, to identify those that are real and to attempt to resolve them. But also to reject those that are false, the result of emotional manipulation and rhetoric, and to make every effort to bring them to light. People must not die because of fake news. It is truly distressing to see the principle of “might makes right” prevailing in so many situations today, all for the sake of legitimizing the pursuit of self-interest. It is troubling to see that the force of international law and humanitarian law seems no longer to be binding, replaced by the alleged right to coerce others. This is unworthy of our humanity, shameful for all mankind and for the leaders of nations. After centuries of history, how can anyone believe that acts of war bring about peace and not backfire on those who commit them? How can we think that we are laying the foundations of the future apart from cooperation and a global vision inspired by the common good? How can we continue to betray the desire of the world’s peoples for peace with propaganda about weapons buildup, as if military supremacy will resolve problems instead of fueling even greater hatred and desire for revenge? People are beginning to realize the amount of money that ends up in the pockets of merchants of death; money that could be used to build new hospitals and schools is instead being used to destroy those that already exist! I ask myself: as Christians, in addition to feeling outraged, speaking out and rolling up our sleeves as peacemakers and promoters of dialogue, what else can we do? I believe that first and foremost we really need to pray. It is up to us to make every tragic news story, every newsreel that we see, a cry of intercession before God. And then to offer help, just as you do and as many others can do through you. Yet there is more, and I say this, thinking in particular of the Christian East: there is witness. It is our call to remain faithful to Jesus, without allowing ourselves to end up in the clutches of power. It is our call to imitate Christ, who conquered evil by the love he showed on the cross, and to show a way of reigning quite different from that of Herod and Pilate. Herod, for fear of being deposed, murdered children, who even today continue to be torn apart by bombs; Pilate washed his hands, as we risk doing every day until we arrive at the point of no return. Let us look to Jesus, who calls us to heal the wounds of history solely by the gentle power of his glorious cross, which radiates the strength of forgiveness, the hope of new beginnings, and the resolve to remain honest and transparent in a sea of corruption. Let us follow Christ, who freed hearts from hatred, and show by our example how to break free of the mindset of division and revenge. I would like to thank and spiritually embrace all those Eastern Christians who respond to evil with good. Thank you, dear brothers and sisters, for the witness you give, especially when you remain in your lands as disciples and witnesses of Christ. Dear friends of ROACO, in your work, you see the immense sufferings caused by war and terrorism – and here I think of the recent terrible attack on the Church of Saint Elias in Damascus – but you also see the seeds of the Gospel taking root in the desert.  You encounter the People of God who persevere by looking up to heaven, praying to God, and loving their neighbors. You experience firsthand the grace and beauty of Eastern traditions, of liturgies that allow God to dwell in time and space, of centuries-old chants imbued with praise, glory, and mystery, which raise an incessant plea for forgiveness for humanity. You encounter men and women who, often nameless, join the great ranks of martyrs and saints of the Christian East. In the dark night of conflict, you are witnesses to the light of the East. I would like this light of wisdom and salvation to be better known in the Catholic Church, where it is still largely unknown and where, in some places, the faith is in danger of becoming lifeless, also because the hope expressed repeatedly bySaint John Paul IIhas not yet been realized. Forty years ago, he said: “The Church must learn once again to breathe with both lungs, the Eastern and the Western” (Address to the Sacred College of Cardinals, 28 June 1985). The Christian East, however, can only be preserved if it is loved, and it can only be loved if it is known. Hence, it is necessary to implement the clear bidding of the Magisterium to become familiar with their treasures, for example by organizing basic courses on the Eastern Churches in Seminaries, Theological Faculties, and Catholic Universities (cf. SAINT JOHN PAUL II, Apostolic LetterOrientale Lumen, 24; CONGREGATION FOR CATHOLIC EDUCATION, Circular LetterEu égard au développement, 9-14). There is also a need for encounter and the sharing of pastoral activity, since Eastern Catholics today are no longer our distant cousins who celebrate unfamiliar rites, but our brothers and sisters who, due to forced migration, are our next-door neighbors. Their sense of the sacred, their deep faith, confirmed by suffering, and their spirituality, redolent of the divine mysteries, can benefit the thirst for God, latent yet at the same present, in the West. Let us entrust this shared growth in faith to the intercession of the Holy Mother of God and of the Apostles Peter and Paul, who united East and West. I bless you and encourage you to persevere in charity, animated by the hope of Christ. Thank you. Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,June,To Redemptorist and Scalabrinian Bishops (26 June 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/june/documents/20250626-redentoristi-scalabriniani.html,"ADDRESS OF POPE LEO XIVTO REDEMPTORIST AND SCALABRINIAN BISHOPS Consistory HallThursday, 26 June 2025 [Multimedia] ____________ In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Peace be with you! Your Eminences, Your Excellencies, Reverend Superiors, I am happy about this meeting, and find the occasion that generates it beautiful: the choice of two Religious Congregations to meet and dialogue with those brethren whose episcopal ministry they have given to the Church. This is an exchange that certainly enriches the Bishops present, your Communities and the entire People of God, as theSecond Vatican Councilteaches (cf. Dogmatic ConstitutionLumenGentium, 7; Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes – Congregation for Bishops,Directives for the Mutual Relations Between Bishops and Religious in the Church, 2). The Church is grateful to your Institutes, of whom it has asked, with the appointment of bishops among its members, a not inconsiderable sacrifice in times of a shortage of religious brothers, when depriving you of confrères engaged in the service of various works entails not a few problems. Perhaps the General will say something to me, but… [laughter]. At the same time, though, it has given a great gift to your Congregations, because service to the universal Church is the most beautiful grace and joy for any religious family, as your Founders would certainly confirm. You in particular, Scalabrinian and Redemptorist religious, chosen and consecrated for service to the Episcopate and also to the Cardinals, bring into your ministry the legacy of two important charisms, especially in our days: service to migrants and the evangelization of the poor and the distant. Saint Alphonsus Maria de’ Liguori, entering into contact with the poverty of the most neglected neighbourhoods of Naples in the eighteenth century, renounced a wealthy life and a lucrative career, embracing the mission of bringing the Gospel to the last. Saint John Baptist Scalabrini, a century later, was able to feel and understand the hopes and sufferings of the many people who left, leaving everything behind, in search of a better future for themselves and their families in faraway lands. Both of them were Founders, became bishops, and knew how to respond to the challenges of social and economic systems which on the one hand opened new frontiers at various levels, but on the other left behind a great deal of unheeded misery and many problems, creating pockets of degradation that no one seemed to want to deal with. At a historic moment that also presents great opportunities and at the same time no shortage of difficulties and contradictions, by celebrating theJubilee of hopewe want to recall that, today as yesterday, the voice to listen to in order to understand what to do is that of “the love of God … poured out into our hearts through the holy Spirit that has been given to us” (Rm5:5). Even in our world, the Lord’s work always goes before us: we are required to conform our minds and hearts to it through wise discernment, and I am convinced that the discussion you have promoted will be very useful to this end. I encourage you, therefore, to maintain and to nurture, also for the future, these relations of fraternal help, with generosity and selflessness, for the good of all Christ’s flock. I thank you for the great work you do, and I bless you heartily, together with all your communities. Thank you!

2025,June,Meditation of the Holy Father on the occasion of the Jubilee of Bishops (25 June 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/june/documents/20250625-giubileo-vescovi.html,"JUBILEE OF BISHOPS MEDITATION OF POPE LEO XIV Altar of the Cathedra in Saint Peter's BasilicaWednesday, 25 June 2025 [Multimedia] ___________________________________ In the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Peace be with you! Dear brothers, good morning and welcome! I deeply appreciate the effort all of you have made to come on pilgrimage to Rome, since I realize how pressing are the demands of your ministry. Yet each of you, like myself, before being a shepherd, is a sheep, a member of the Lord’s flock. So we too, even before others, are asked to pass through the Holy Door, the symbol of Christ the Saviour. If we are to lead the Churches entrusted to our care, we must let ourselves be profoundly renewed by Jesus, the Good Shepherd, in order to conform ourselves fully to his heart and to the mystery of his love. “Spes non confundit,” “Hope does not disappoint” (Rom5:5). How often did we hearPope Francisrepeat those words of Saint Paul! They became one of his trademark phrases, so much so that he chose them to be the opening words of theBull of Indiction of this Jubilee Year. We, as Bishops, are the primary heirs of that prophetic legacy, which we must preserve and transmit to the People of God by our words and the way we live our lives. At times, preaching the message that hope does not disappoint means swimming against the tide, even in certain painful situations that appear to be hopeless. Yet it is precisely at those times when it becomes all the more apparent that our faith and our hope do not come from ourselves, but from God. If we are truly close to those who suffer, the Holy Spirit can revive in their hearts even a flame that has all but died out (cf. BullSpes Non Confundit, 3). Dear friends, a Bishop is a witness to hope by his example of a life firmly grounded in God and completely devoted to the service of the Church. This will be the case only insofar as he is conformed to Christ in his personal life and in his apostolic ministry. The Spirit of the Lord will then shape his way of thinking, his feelings and his actions. Let us stop for a moment and together consider a few aspects of this witness. First, the Bishop is thevisible principle of unityin the particular Church entrusted to him. It is his duty to build communion among its members and with the universal Church by fostering the variety of gifts and ministries given for its own growth and for the spread of the Gospel. In this service, as in his entire mission, the Bishop can count on the special divine grace conferred on him at his episcopal ordination. This grace sustains him as a teacher of the faith, a minister of sanctification and a spiritual leader; it strengthens his commitment to the Kingdom of God, to the eternal salvation of souls and to the transformation of history by the power of the Gospel. The second aspect I would like to consider, again in the light of Christ as the model of the Bishop’s life, could be put this way: the Bishop isa man who lives the theological life. In a word, he is a person completely docile to the promptings of the Holy Spirit, who fills him with faith, hope and charity, and fans them into flame amid the various situations and challenges of daily life. The Bishop, then, is aman offaith. Here I think of that marvelous passage in the Letter to the Hebrews (cf.Heb11), where the author lists an entire genealogy of “witnesses” of faith, beginning with Abel. I think specifically of Moses, who was called by God to lead the people to the promised land, and who, we are told, “remained steadfast, as if seeing him who is unseen” (Heb11:27). Here we have a magnificent portrayal of a man of faith: he is one who, by the grace of God, sees ahead, glimpses the goal, and perseveres in times of trial. Think of all the times that Moses interceded for the people before God. So too, the Bishop in his Church acts as an intercessor, because the Spirit keeps the flame of faith alive in his heart. Then too, the Bishop is aman of hope, since “faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen” (Heb11:1). Especially at moments of difficulty in people’s lives, the Bishop, by this theological virtue, helps them not to despair: not simply by his words but by his closeness. When families are greatly burdened and public institutions fail to provide adequate support; when young people are disillusioned and fed up with empty promises; when the elderly and those with grave disabilities feel abandoned, the Bishop is close to them, not offering easy solutions, but rather the experience of communities that strive to live the Gospel in simplicity and solidarity. Faith and hope then come together in him as aman of pastoral charity. The whole life of the Bishop, his entire ministry, diverse and multifaceted as it is, finds its unity in what Saint Augustine calls theamoris officium. Here his theological life is expressed and shines forth in the highest degree. Whether preaching, visiting communities, listening to priests and deacons, or making administrative decisions, all that he does is inspired and motivated by the charity of Christ the Shepherd. With the help of God’s grace, drawn daily from the celebration of the Eucharist and his prayer, the Bishop gives an example of fraternal love to his Coadjutor or Auxiliary, to the Bishop Emeritus and to the Bishops of neighboring dioceses, to the priests, his closest collaborators, particularly those experiencing moments of difficulty or illness. His heart is open and welcoming, and so is his home. Dear brothers, this is the theological core of the life of a Bishop. Centered on these aspects, and always awakened by the same Spirit, a number of other essential virtues can be added: pastoral prudence, poverty, perfect continence in celibacy, and human virtues. Pastoral prudenceis the practical wisdom that guides the Bishop in his decisions, in his governance, in his relations with the faithful and with their associations. A clear sign of prudence is his exercise of dialogue as a style and method, both in his relationships with others and in his presiding over participatory bodies: in other words, in his overseeing of synodality in his particular Church.Pope Francistaught us much in this regard, insisting with pedagogical wisdom on synodality as a dimension of the life of the Church. Pastoral prudence also enables the Bishop to guide the diocesan community by cherishing its traditions and by promoting new directions and initiatives. To bear witness to the Lord Jesus, the Bishop lives a life of evangelicalpoverty. His is a simple, sober and generous lifestyle, dignified and at the same time suited to the conditions of the majority of his people. The poor must find in him a father and a brother, and never feel uncomfortable in meeting him or entering his home. In his personal life, he must be detached from the pursuit of wealth and from forms of favoritism based on money or power. The Bishop must never forget that, like Jesus, he has been anointed with the Holy Spirit and sent to bring good news to the poor (cf.Lk4:18). Together with material poverty, the life of the Bishop is also marked by that specific form of poverty which iscelibacy and virginityfor the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven (cf.Mt19:12). Here, it is not just a question of living as a celibate, but of practicing chastity of heart and conduct, and in this way living a life of Christian discipleship and presenting to all the authentic image of the Church, holy and chaste in her members as in her Head. He must be firm and decisive in dealing with situations that can cause scandal and with every case of abuse, especially involving minors, and fully respect the legislation currently in force. Finally, the Bishop is called to cultivate those human virtues which the Council Fathers also chose to mention in the DecreePresbyterorum Ordinis(No. 3). These are of great help to him in his ministry and in his relationships with others. They include fairness, sincerity, magnanimity, openness of mind and heart, the ability to rejoice with those who rejoice and to suffer with those who suffer, as well as self-control, delicacy, patience, discretion, great openness to listening and engaging in dialogue, and willingness to serve. These virtues, which each of us possess to a greater or lesser extent by nature, can and must be cultivated in conformity to the Lord Jesus, with the grace of the Holy Spirit. Dear brothers, may the prayers of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Saints Peter and Paul obtain for you and your communities the graces that you most need. In particular, may they help you to be men of communion, always promoting unity in the diocesan presbyterate. May every priest, without exception, sense the fatherhood, brotherhood and friendship of his Bishop. That spirit of communion encourages priests in their pastoral outreach and makes the particular Church grow in unity. Thank you for remembering me in your prayers! I am also praying for you and from my heart, I offer all of you my blessing. Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,June,To the Seminarians of the Dioceses of Triveneto (25 June 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/june/documents/20250625-seminaristi-triveneto.html,"ADDRESS OF POPE LEO XIVTO THE SEMINARIANS OF THE DIOCESES OF TRIVENETO Largo Giovanni Paolo IIWednesday, 25 June 2025 [Multimedia] ______________ Good morning, good morning! In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Peace be with you! Dear brothers in the Episcopate,dear formators and seminarians of the diocese of Triveneto, I am pleased to be able to meet you on the occasion of the Jubilee pilgrimage. I think that everyone was presentyesterdaytoo, so this is the second opportunity. Your land has deep Christian roots, which lead us back to the ancient Church of Aquileia. In this spiritual memory of faith, the witness of many martyrs and pastor saints shines. Let us remember the bishop Chromatius; let us remember Jerome and Rufinus, exemplary in study and in ascetic life; as well as the blesseds Tullio Maruzzo and Giovanni Schiavo, missionaries who spread the Gospel in many peoples, languages and cultures. Today it is up to us to continue this exciting work. In particular, you seminarians are called to be part of this rich history of grace, to conserve it and renew it in following the Lord. Do not be discouraged if at times the journey ahead of you becomes hard. AsBlessed John Paul Isaid to the clergy of Rome, train yourselves in the discipline of a “continued, long, and difficult effort. Even the angels that Jacob saw in a dream were not flying, but climbing one step at a time; you can just imagine us, poor men without wings” (Address to the Roman clergy, 7 September 1978). Thus spoke a Pastor in whom the best virtues of your people shone: in him you have a true model of priestly life. I would also like to recall a passage from the conversion of Saint Augustine, as he himself relates it to us in hisConfessions. On the one hand he was eager to decide for Christ; on the other, he was held back by scruples and temptations. Profoundly troubled, one day he retreated to reflect in the garden at home; and the personification of the virtue of Continence appeared to him, saying: “Why do you stand in your own strength, and so standest not? Cast yourself upon Him; fear not, He will not withdraw that you should fall; cast yourself upon Him without fear, He will receive you, and heal you” (Confessions, VIII, 27). As a father, I repeat these same words to you, which were so good for Augustine’s restless heart: they do not apply only with regard to celibacy, which is a charism to be acknowledged, conserved and educated, but can guide your entire journey of discernment and formation in ordained ministry. In particular, these words invite you to have boundless trust in the Lord, the Lord who called you, renouncing the pretence of being sufficient for yourselves or of being able to do it alone. And this applies not only to the seminary years, but to your whole life: at all times, all the more so in those of desolation or even sin, repeat to yourselves the words of the psalmist: “I trust in God’s mercy forever and ever” (Ps52:10). The Word of God and the Sacraments are perennial sources from which you will always be able to draw new lymph for the spiritual life, and also for pastoral commitment. Therefore, do not think of yourselves asalone, norby yourselves.Without doubt – as theRatio fundamentalisstates – each one of you “is the protagonist of his own formation and is called to a journey of constant growth in the human, spiritual, intellectual and pastoral spheres” (Congregation for the Clergy,The gift of priestly formation, 130); butprotagonistsdoes not meansoloists! Therefore, I invite you always to cultivate communion, first of all with your seminary companions. Have complete trust in your formators, without reserve or duplicity. And you, formators, be good companions to the seminarians entrusted to you: offer them the humble witness of your life and your faith; accompany them with sincere affection. Know that you are all supported by the Church, first and foremost in the person of the Bishop. Finally, the most important thing: keep your eyes fixed on Jesus (cf.Heb12:2), cultivating the relationship of friendship with Him. In this regard, as the English priest Robert Hugh Benson (1871-1914) wrote after his conversion to Catholicism: “If there is anything clear in the Gospels it is this – that Jesus Christ first and foremost desires our friendship. … Now the consciousness of this friendship of Jesus Christ is the very secret of the Saints” (The Friendship of Christ, Milan 2024, 17). He asks you, as Pope Francis wrote in the EncyclicalDilexit nos, “never to be ashamed to tell others, with all due discretion and respect, about your friendship with him. He asks that you dare to tell others how good and beautiful it is that you found him” (no. 211). Indeed, encountering Jesus saves our life and gives us the strength and the joy to communicate the Gospel to everyone. Dear friends, thank you for this visit. I wish you a good journey! May Our Lady always accompany you, and also my blessing. Thank you! [Recitation of the Lord’s Prayer] [Blessing] Have a good day! Thank you very much, and I wish you a good journey of faith!______________________ Holy See Press Office Bulletin, 25 June 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,June,Meditation of the Holy Father on the occasion of the Jubilee of Seminarians (24 June 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/june/documents/20250624-giubileo-seminaristi.html,"JUBILEE OF SEMINARIANS MEDITATION OF POPE LEO XIV Altar of the Confessio in Saint Peter's BasilicaTuesday, 24 June 2025 [Multimedia] ___________________________________ In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.Peace be with you! Good morning to everyone: Your Eminences, Your Excellencies, dear formators and above all, the seminarians present. I am very happy to be with you, and I thank all of you, seminarians and formators alike, for your warm reception. Thank you especially for your joy and your enthusiasm. Thank you too, because with your energy you feed the flame of hope in the life of the Church! Today, you are not onlypilgrims, but alsowitnesses of hope. You are witnesses to me and to everyone, because you wish to share in the exciting adventure of priesthood in these challenging times. You have accepted the Lord’s call to become gentle and strong preachers of his saving word and servants of a Church that is open and pressing ahead with missionary zeal. [Let me say a word in Spanish. Thank you for having accepted the Lord’s invitation with courage, an invitation to follow him, to be a disciple, and to enter the seminary. Be strong and unafraid!] You are saying “yes” to Christ’s call, and doing so with humility and courage. Your “yes” to Christ is maturing within the life of the Church, as you allow yourselves to be guided on the necessary path of discernment and formation. Jesus, as you know, calls you, before all else, to have an experience of friendship with him and with your other companions on the journey (cf.Mk3:13). An experience that will continue to grow, also after ordination, and affect every part of your life. Indeed, nothing of your personal uniqueness should be put aside; rather, everything should be taken up and transformed, like the grain of wheat in the Gospel. The goal is to become a joyful man and a joyful priest, a “bridge”, not an obstacle for those who come to you in order to come to Christ. He must increase and we must decrease. In that way, we can be shepherds after his own Heart.[1] Speaking of the Heart of Jesus Christ, how can we not be reminded of the EncyclicalDilexit Nosof our late beloved Pope Francis?[2]Precisely at this time in your lives, in this season of formation and discernment, it is important to attend to your own hearts, the core of your being and the “engine” that drives your journey through life. Seminaries are meant to be training grounds in this regard. Especially nowadays, in societies and cultural contexts marked by conflict and narcissism, we need to learn how to love and how to do so as Jesus did.[3] Just as Jesus loved with a human heart,[4]so you are called to love with the Heart of Christ! [in Spanish: To love with the heart of Jesus!] To learn this art, however, you need to work on your interior life. That is the place where God makes his voice heard, and where the deepest decisions of our lives take shape. It is also the place where you will encounter the tensions and struggles (Mk7:14-23) that summon you to conversion, so that your entire life can breathe the fragrance of the Gospel.  Your first job, then, is to work on your interior life. Keep in mind Saint Augustine’s constant invitation to return to the heart, because it is there that we will find God. Sometimes descending to the depths of our heart can be intimidating, since we also have to confront our hurts, our wounds. Yet do not be afraid to face them, also with the help of others, because those wounds will make you sympathetic and compassionate towards others who suffer. Without an interior life, no real spiritual life is possible, because it is in the heart that God speaks to us. God speaks in the heart, and we have to learn how to hear his voice. Part of this process is learning how to read the movements of the heart: not only the instant and fleeting emotions typical of youth, but also and above all the feelings that will help you discover the right direction in life. If you learn to know your heart, you will be more genuine and not feel the need to hide behind masks. The royal road that leads to a rich interior life is prayer. In an age of “hyper-connectivity,” it is harder and harder to experience silence and solitude. Yet unless we encounter God, we will never really be able to know ourselves. I would ask you to pray often to the Holy Spirit, so that he can mold within you a docile heart, capable of embracing the presence of God, also by listening to the voice of nature, of art, poetry, literature,[5]music, as well the human sciences.[6]In your disciplined study of theology, listen with an open mind and heart to the voices rising up from our culture, as, for example, the recent challenges posed by artificial intelligence and social media.[7][]Above all, do as Jesus did. Learn to hear the often silent cry of the little ones, of the poor and the oppressed, and so many others, especially the young, who are searching for meaning in their life. If you cultivate your heart through daily periods of silence, meditation, and prayer, you will learn the art of discernment. This, too, is important: learning discernment. When we are young, we overflow with desires, dreams and ambitions. Our hearts can often be overwhelmed and bewildered. On the other hand, if we follow the example of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we will surely learn to keep all those things in our heart and meditate on them. Saint Luke tells us that Mary couldsynballein(Lk2:19, 51), “hold together”, all these things in her heart.[8][]Avoid superficiality and hold the pieces of your life together through prayer and meditation. Ask yourself, what is my life experience teaching me? What does it tell me about the direction my life is taking? Where is the Lord leading me? Dear friends, have a meek and humble heart like that of Jesus (cf.Mt11:29). As the apostle Paul urges (Phil2:5ff), put on the mind of Christ and grow in human maturity, especially emotional and interpersonal maturity. It is important, and indeed necessary, that beginning with your time in the seminary, you strive for growth in human maturity, eliminating all forms of dissimulation and hypocrisy. Keep your gaze fixed on Jesus. You need to learn, too, how to acknowledge and express your emotions of sadness, fear, anxiety and indignation, and to bring these to your relationship with the Lord.  Crises, limitations and weakness are not something to be concealed; they are in fact occasions of grace, which can lead you to a deeper share in the paschal mystery. In a world so often marked by ingratitude and the thirst for power, where a throwaway culture seems to abound, you are called to be witnesses of gratitude to Christ for his abundant grace, as well as the joy, the tenderness and the mercy of his Heart. To learn how to approach and accept others, and to be generous and disinterested in your ministry. Allow the Holy Spirit to “anoint” your human qualities even prior to the anointing you will receive at your ordination. The Heart of Christ is compelled by immense compassion. He is the Good Samaritan of all humanity, who tells us: “Go and do likewise” (Lk10:37). This compassion drove him to break the bread of the word for the crowds and to teach them the meaning of sharing (cf.Mk6:30-44). In this way, he gave us a glimpse of what he was later to do in the Upper Room and on the Cross, as he gave us his very self as food. To us, as to the disciples, he says: “Give them something to eat” (Mk6:37). In a word, make your entire life a gift of love. Dear seminarians, in her wisdom, Mother Church, with the help of the Holy Spirit, has always sought the most fitting ways to train her ordained ministers, keeping in mind the needs of different places. What is your own responsibility in this? Certainly, not to be content with the minimum, or to settle for being passive recipients of formation. Instead, you are called to be passionate about your preparation for priestly life, living fully in the present and looking to the future with a prophetic heart. I hope that this meeting will help each of you to deepen your personal dialogue with the Lord and to ask him to help you put on ever more fully the mind of Christ and the sentiments of his Heart. That Heart beats with love for you and all humanity. Keep pressing forward! I accompany you on your journey and I now give you my blessing. __________________________________________  [1]Cf.

2025,June,To Participants in the Jubilee of Governments (21 June 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/june/documents/20250621-giubileo-governanti.html,"ADDRESS OF POPE LEO XIVTO MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL INTER-PARLIAMENTARY UNION Hall of BenedictionSaturday, 21 June 2025 [Multimedia] ___________________________________ Madam President of the Council of Ministers, and Mr President of the Chamber of Deputies of the Republic of Italy,Madam President and Mr Secretary General of the Inter-Parliamentary Union,Distinguished Representatives of Academic Institutions and Religious Leaders, I am pleased that we can meet in the context of the Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, during the present Jubilee of Governments. I offer a warm greeting to the members of the Delegations coming from sixty-eight different countries, and, in a particular way, the Presidents of the respective Parliamentary Institutions. Politics has rightly been defined as “the highest form of charity,” quotingPope Pius XI(Address to the Italian Catholic University Federation, 18 December 1927). Indeed, if we consider the service that political life renders to society and to the common good, it can truly be seen as an act of Christian love, which is never simply a theory, but always a concrete sign and witness of God’s constant concern for the good of our human family (cf. Francis, Encyclical LetterFratelli Tutti, 176-192). In this regard, I would like to share with you this morning three considerations that I deem important in the current cultural context. The first concerns your responsibility to promote and protect, independent of any special interest,the good of the community,the common good, particularly by defending the vulnerable and the marginalized. This would mean, for example, working to overcome the unacceptable disproportion between the immense wealth concentrated in the hands of a few and the world’s poor (cf. Leo XIII, Encyclical LetterRerum Novarum, 15 May 1891, 1). Those who live in extreme conditions cry out to make their voices heard, and often find no ears willing to hear their plea. This imbalance generates situations of persistent injustice, which readily lead to violence and, sooner or later, to the tragedy of war. Sound politics, on the other hand, by promoting the equitable distribution of resources, can offer an effective service to harmony and peace both domestically and internationally. My second reflection has to do withreligious freedom andinterreligious dialogue. This area has taken on greater significance in the present time, and political life can achieve much by encouraging the conditions for there to be authentic religious freedom and that a respectful and constructive encounter between different religious communities may develop. Belief in God, with the positive values that derive from it, is an immense source of goodness and truth for the lives of individuals and communities. Saint Augustine spoke of the need to pass fromamor sui– egotistic, myopic and destructive self-love – toamor Dei– a free and generous love, grounded in God and leading to the gift of self. That passage, he taught, is essential for the building of thecivitas Dei, a society whose fundamental law is charity (cf.De Civitate Dei, XIV, 28). In order to have a shared point of reference in political activity, and not excludea prioriany consideration of the transcendent in decision-making processes, it would be helpful to seek an element that unites everyone. To this end, an essential reference point is thenatural law, written not by human hands, but acknowledged as valid in all times and places, and finding its most plausible and convincing argument in nature itself. In the words of Cicero, already an authoritative exponent of this law in antiquity, I quote fromDe Re Publica: “Natural law is right reason, in accordance with nature, universal, constant and eternal, which with its commands, invites us to do what is right and with its prohibitions deters us from evil... No change may be made to this law, nor may any part of it be removed, nor can it be abolished altogether; neither by the Senate nor by the people, can we free ourselves from it, nor is it necessary to seek its commentator or interpreter. And there shall be no law in Rome, none in Athens, none now, none later; but one eternal and unchanging law shall govern all peoples at all times” (III, 22). Natural law, which is universally valid apart from and above other more debatable beliefs, constitutes the compass by which to take our bearings in legislating and acting, particularly on the delicate and pressing ethical issues that, today more than in the past, regard personal life and privacy. TheUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, approved and proclaimed by the United Nations on 10 December 1948, is now part of humanity’s cultural heritage. That text, which is always relevant, can contribute greatly to placing the human person, in his or her inviolable integrity, at the foundation of the quest for truth, thus restoring dignity to those who do not feel respected in their inmost being and in the dictates of their conscience. This brings us to a third consideration. The degree of civilization attained in our world and the goals you are charged to achieve are now facing a major challenge in the form of artificial intelligence. This is a development that will certainly be of great help to society, provided that its employment does not undermine the identity and dignity of the human person and his or her fundamental freedoms. In particular, it must not be forgotten that artificial intelligence functions as a tool for the good of human beings, not to diminish them, not to replace them. What is emerging is in fact a significant challenge, one that calls for great attention and foresight in order to project, also in the context of new scenarios, healthy, fair and sound lifestyles, especially for the good of younger generations. Our personal life has greater value than any algorithm, and social relationships require spaces for development that far transcend the limited patterns that any soulless machine can pre-package. Let us not forget that, while able to store millions of data points and answer many questions in a matter of seconds, artificial intelligence remains equipped with a “static memory” that is in no way comparable to that of human beings. Our memory, on the other hand, is creative, dynamic, generative, capable of uniting past, present and future in a lively and fruitful search for meaning, with all the ethical and existential implications that this entails (cf. Francis,Address to the G7 Session on Artificial Intelligence, 14 June 2024). Politics cannot ignore a challenge of this magnitude. On the contrary, it is called to respond to many citizens who rightly look with both confidence and concern at the issues raised by this new digital culture. During the Jubilee of the Year 2000,Saint John Paul IIindicated Saint Thomas More as a witness for political leaders to revere and an intercessor under whose protection to place their work. Sir Thomas More was a man faithful to his civic responsibilities, a perfect servant of the state precisely because of his faith, which led him to view politics not as a profession but as a mission for the spread of truth and goodness. He “placed his public activity at the service of the person, especially the weak and poor; he handled social disputes with an exquisite sense of justice; he protected the family and defended it with strenuous commitment; and he promoted the integral education of youth” (Apostolic LetterE Sancti Thomae Mori, 31 October 2000, 4). The courage he showed by his readiness to sacrifice his life rather than betray the truth makes him, also for us today, a martyr for freedom and for the primacy of conscience. May his example be a source of inspiration and guidance for each of you! Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen, I thank you for your visit. I offer my prayerful good wishes for your work and upon you and your loved ones, I invoke God’s abundant blessings. Thank you to all of you. God’s blessings upon you and your work. Thank you.

2025,June,To the Participants in the General Chapters of the Conventual Franciscans and of the Order of the Most Holy Trinity and of the Captives (Trinitarians) (20 June 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/june/documents/20250620-capitoli-generali.html,"ADDRESS OF POPE LEO XIVTO PARTICIPANTS IN THE GENERAL CHAPTERS OF THE CONVENTUAL FRANCISCANS AND OF THE ORDER OF THE MOST HOLY TRINITY AND OF THE CAPTIVES (TRINITARIANS) Clementine HallFriday, 20 June 2025 [Multimedia] ___________________________________ In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Peace be with you! Welcome, dear brothers and sisters! I greet in particular the Superiors General – both were confirmed – the Counsellors and the Capitulars of the Order of Friars Minor Conventual and those of the Order of the Most Holy Trinity and of Captives, as well as the delegates of the Third Order and of the lay groups. In order to be able to welcome Franciscans and Trinitarians together, I recalled a painting located in the apse of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran, which depicts an audience of which this could be a fine re-evocation. Indeed, the image shows Pope Innocent III receiving Saint Francis and Saint Juan de Mata together, to honour their great contribution to the reform of religious life. It is interesting to note that Saint Francis is depicted kneeling with an enormous open book, almost as if he were about to say to the Pontiff: “Your Holiness, I ask only to live the rule of the Holy Gospelsine glossa” (cf.Text14-15). Saint Juan de Mata, instead, is standing and holds in his hand the Rule that he has drawn up together with the Pontiff. Whereas Saint Francis demonstrates his docility to the Church, presenting his project not as his own but as a divine gift, Saint Juan de Mata shows the approved text, after study and discernment, as the culmination of a task that was absolutely necessary to accomplish the purpose that God has inspired. The two attitudes, far from being opposed to one another, would have enlightened each other and been a guideline for the service that the Holy See has provided to all charisms ever since. God inspired in these two Saints not only a spiritual path of service, but also the desire to speak with the Successor of Peter about the gift received by the Spirit, so as to make it available to the Church. Saint Francis expounded to the Pope the need to follow Jesus without reserve, without other ends, without ambiguousness or artifice. Saint Juan de Mata expressed this truth with words that would then prove to be fundamental, and which Saint Francis would make his own. A good example would be that of living “without anything of one’s own”, without anything “hidden in the chamber of the pocket or the heart”, as Pope Francis emphasized (cf.Address to the Canonesses of the Order of the Holy Spirit, 5 December 2024). Another of these terms expresses the need for such devotion to be transformed into service, that the superior is perceived as a ministry, that is, he who makes himself the smallest in order to be a servant to all. It is interesting to note how Saint Matthew’s verse (cf. 20:27) has influenced the vocabulary of religious life as a whole, because calling a prior, master,magisteror minister shapes the entire concept of authority as service. To make this gift current, you Trinitarians wanted to focus on the purpose of your Institute: to bring consolation to those who cannot live the faith in freedom. During these months you have prayed this intention, following the words of Saint Paul: “Persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed” (2 Cor4:9), which inspire the motto of your Chapter. I join in this prayer, and I also ask God the Trinity that this may be one of the fruits of your assembly: that you may not cease to remember in your prayer and in your daily efforts those who are persecuted due to their faith. That part, the third part - concerning the persecuted - is, according to the teaching of Saint Augustine, the part of God and that which marks the vocation of the liberator of his people (cf.Questionson theHeptateuch, Bk. II, 15). Moreover, this attention towards the most suffering members of the Church will attract the attention of vocations, the faithful and people of good will to this reality and will keep you available for the frontier services you carry out in the Arabian Peninsula, the Middle East, Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Another essential element of your purpose, Friars Minor Conventual, in this Chapter, was to carry out discernment on the regulations of the General and Provincial Chapters, because in these, “one speaks about matters of God”. It is not our personal interest that should move us, but that of Christ; it is his Spirit that we must listen to, first and foremost, in order to “write the future in the present”, as the motto of your Chapter says. Listen to him in the voice of your brother, in the discernment of your community, in attentiveness to the signs of the times, and in the appeals of the Magisterium. Dear sons of Saint Francis of Assisi, on the eight-hundredth anniversary of the composition of theCanticle of the Creatures, orBrother Sun, I urge each one of you personally, and in each of your fraternities, to be a living reminder of the primacy of the praise of God in Christian life. Moreover, let me not forget that you Conventuals are also celebrating the anniversary of your renewed presence in the Far East. Dear friends, I would like to conclude this meeting with thePraises of God Most High, thetrisagionwritten by Saint Francis: “You are the holy Lord God who does wonderful things. You are strong. You are great. You are the Most High. You are the almighty King. You, holy Father, King of heaven and earth” (Franciscan Sources, 261). Thank you to you all, and may God bless you!______________________ Holy See Press Office Bulletin, 20 June 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,June,To Priests of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy returning after a missionary year (20 June 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/june/documents/20250620-sacerdoti.html,"ADDRESS OF POPE LEO XIVTO PRIESTS OF THEPONTIFICAL ECCLESIASTICAL ACADEMYRETURNING AFTER A YEAR DOING MISSIONARY WORK Apostolic PalaceFriday, 20 June 2025 [Multimedia] ___________________________________ I am pleased to meet you today, and to address my cordial greeting to every one of you. I welcome your President, Archbishop Salvatore Pennacchio, your Prefect of Studies, Msgr. Gabriel Viola, and you, dearest Priests, who have just returned from your experience of the Missionary Year, the culmination of your formation at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. Last week, meeting your companions of theAlma materof the pontifical diplomats, I had the opportunity to reiterate the value of this formative insight, introduced by my venerable Predecessor. I urged them to be and to remain “pastors with your feet on the ground”, to embody that figure of the priest in the service of the Pope in the pontifical Representations, clearly outlined in the ChirographThe Petrine Ministry, with which it was intended to give new impetus to your centuries-old institution, as it approaches the celebration of the 325thanniversary of its founding. As I affirmed in various meetings in the context of the recent Jubilee of the Holy See, the guardianship of that care for all the Churches – proper to the ministry entrusted to me – needs the faithful and irreplaceable service of the Secretariat of State and of the Pontifical Representations, which whom you will soon begin to collaborate. Therefore, I urge you too to exercise the gift of your priesthood with humility and meekness, the capacity for listening and proximity, as faithful and tireless disciples of Christ the Good Shepherd. Whatever the tasks entrusted to you may be, in whatever part of the world you may find yourselves, the Pope must be able to count on priests who, in prayer as in work, do not spare themselves in bringing his closeness to the peoples and to the Churches with their witness. I thank you again for the docility and self-sacrifice with which you have spent the past year in the most diverse contexts, and I warmly bless the start of your ministry in the diplomatic service of the Holy See. _____________________ Holy See Press Office Bulletin, 20 June 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,June,To participants in the event promoted by the Cardinal Domenico Bartolucci Foundation (18 June 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/june/documents/20250618-fondazione-bartolucci.html,"ADDRESS OF THE HOLY FATHER LEO XIVTO PARTICIPANTS IN THE EVENT PROMOTED BY THE CARDINAL DOMENICO BARTOLUCCI FOUNDATION Sala RegiaWednesday, 18 June 2025 [Multimedia] ___________________________________ Dear brothers and sisters, welcome! I greet His Eminence Cardinal Dominique Mamberti, Sr. Raffaella Petrini, the esteemed speakers and the distinguished guests. I joyfully participate in this meeting in which, with words and in music, we celebrate the new Philatelic Collection promoted by the Bartolucci Foundation and issued by the Vatican Post on the occasion of the five-hundredth anniversary of the birth of Palestrina. Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrine was, in the history of the Church, one of the composers who has contributed the most to the promotion of sacred music, for “the glory of God and the sanctification and edification of the faithful” (Saint Pius X, Motu proprioInter plurimas pastoralis officii sollicitudines, 22 November 1903, 1), in the delicate, yet at the same time exciting, context of the Counter-Reformation. His compositions, solemn and austere, inspired by Gregorian chant, closely unite music and liturgy, “whether [they] add delight to prayer, foster unity of minds, or confer greater solemnity upon the sacred rites” (Second Vatican Ecumenical Council, ConstitutionSacrosanctum Concilium, 112). Moreover, polyphony itself is a musical form rich in meaning, for prayer and for Christian life. Indeed, first of all it is inspired by the sacred Text, which proposes to “clothe with a fitting melody” (Inter sollicitudines, 1) so that it may better reach “the intelligence of the faithful” (ibid.). Moreover, it achieves this purpose by entrusting the words to several voices, each repeating them in its own original way, with varied and complementary melodic and harmonious movements. Finally, it harmonizes the whole thanks to the skill with which the composer develops and intertwines the melodies, respecting the rules of counterpoint, making them echo one another, sometimes even creating dissonances, which are then resolved in new chords. The effect of this dynamic unity in diversity - a metaphor for our common journey of faith under the guidance of the Holy Spirit - is to help the listener enter ever more deeply into the mystery expressed by the words, responding, where appropriate, with responsories orin alternatim. Thanks precisely to this richness of form and content, the Roman polyphonic tradition, besides leaving us an immense heritage of art and spirituality, continues even today, in the sphere of music, to be a point of reference to look to, albeit with due adaptations, in sacred and liturgical composition, so that through song, “all the faithful should be led to that fully conscious and active participation in liturgical celebrations” (Sacrosanctum Concilium, 14), with the profound involvement of voice, mind and heart. Of all this theMissaPapae Marcelli, in its genre, is a quintessential example, as is the precious repertoire of compositions left to us by the unforgettable Cardinal Domenico Bartolucci, illustrious composer and for almost fifty years the director of the Pontifical Sistine Chapel Choir. I therefore thank all those who have made this meeting possible: the Bartolucci Foundation, the speakers, the choirs and all of you. I will remember you in my prayer. Saint Augustine, speaking of the chant of the Easter Alleluia, said: “So now, my dear brothers and sisters, let us sing. … In the way travellers are in the habit of singing; sing, but keep on walking. … Make some progress, make progress in goodness. … Sing, and keep on walking. Don’t stray off the road, don’t go back, don’t stay where you are” (Sermon256, 3). Let us embrace his invitation, especially in this holy time of the Jubilee. To all of you, my blessing.______________________________ Holy See Press Office Bulletin, 18 June 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"

And I too, on the evening of the election, wanted to echo the announcement of the Risen Lord: “Peace be with you!” (cf.Lk24:3;Jn20:19). I thank you for your prayer and for that of your communities: I am in great need of them! I am grateful, in particular, to Cardinal Zuppi, also for the words he addressed to me. I greet the three Vice Presidents, the Secretary General, and every one of you. The history of the Church in Italy shows the particular bond that unites you to the Pope and that – according to the Statutes of the Italian Episcopal Conference – “qualifies in a special way the communion of the Conference with the Roman Pontiff” (Art. 4 § 2). Following the example of my predecessors, I too am aware of the relevance of this “common and particular” relationship, as it was defined bySaint Paul VI, speaking at the first General Assembly of the Italian Episcopal Conference (cf.Address, 23 June 1966). In exercising my ministry together with you, dear brothers, I would like to be inspired by the principles of collegiality, which were elaborated byVatican Council II; in particular, the DecreeChristus Dominus, which emphasizes that the Lord Jesus constituted the Apostles in the manner of a college or stable class, of which he placed Peter, chosen from among them (cf. n. 19). It is in this way that you are called to live out your ministry: collegiality among yourselves and collegiality with the successor of Peter. This principle of communion is also reflected in a healthy cooperation with the civil authorities. The Italian Episcopal Conference is indeed a space for discussion and the synthesis of the bishops’ thought regarding issues most relevant for the common good. Where necessary, it guides and coordinates the relations between the individual bishops and the regional episcopal Conferences with such authorities at the local level. Pope Benedict XVI, in 2006, described the Church in Italy as “a lively reality … which conserves a capillary presence in the midst of people of every age and level” and where “Christian traditions often continue to be rooted and to produce fruit” (Address to participants in the Fourth National Ecclesial Convention, 19 October 2006). Nevertheless, the Christian Community in this country has been facing new challenges for some time, linked to secularism, a certain disaffection with the faith, and the demographic crisis. In this context,Pope Francisobserved, “It takes boldness to avoid getting used to situations that are so deeply rooted as to seem normal or insurmountable. Prophecy”, he says, “does not exact wrenches but courageous choices, proper for a true ecclesial community: they lead us to allow ourselves to be ‘troubled’ by events and persons and to enter into human situations, animated by the healing spirit of the Beatitudes” (Address at the opening of the 70th General Assembly of the Italian Episcopal Conference, 22 May 2017). By virtue of the special bond between the Pope and the Italian bishops, I would like to indicate some pastoral concerns that the Lord places in our path and which require reflection, concrete action and evangelical witness. First of all, there is a need for renewed zeal in the proclamation and transmission of faith. It is a question of placing Jesus Christ at the centre and, following the path indicated byEvangelii gaudium, helping people to live out a personal relationship with Him, to discover the joy of the Gospel. In a time of great fragmentation, it is necessary to return to the foundation of our faith, to thekerygma.This is the first major commitment that motivates all the others: to bring Christ “into the veins” of humanity (cf. Apostolic ConstitutionHumanae salutis, 3), renewing and sharing the apostolic mission: “What we have seen and heard, we proclaim now to you” (1 Jn1:3). And it is a question of discerning the ways in which the Good News can be made to reach everyone, with pastoral actions capable of intercepting those who are most distant, and with tools suitable for the renewal of catechesis and the languages of proclamation. The relationship with Christ calls on us to develop a pastoral focus on the theme of peace. Indeed, the Lord sends us into the world to bring his same gift: “Peace be with you!”, and to become its creators in everyday life. I am thinking of parishes, neighbourhoods, areas within the country, the urban and existential peripheries. There, where human and social relationships become difficult and conflict takes shape, perhaps subtly, a Church capable of reconciliation must make herself visible. The apostle Paul urges us, “If possible, on your part, live at peace with all” (Rm12:18); it is an invitation that entrusts a tangible portion of responsibility to every person. I hope, then, that every diocese may promote pathways of education in non-violence, mediation initiatives in local conflicts, and welcoming projects that transform fear of the other into an opportunity for encounter. May every community become a “house of peace”, where one learns how to defuse hostility through dialogue, where justice is practiced and forgiveness is cherished. Peace is not a spiritual utopia: it is a humble path, made up of daily gestures that interweave patience and courage, listening and action, and which demands today, more than ever, our vigilant and generative presence. Then there are the challenges that call into question respect for the dignity of the human person. Artificial intelligence, biotechnologies, data economy and social media are profoundly transforming our perception and our experience of life. In this scenario, human dignity risks becoming diminished or forgotten, substituted by functions, automatism, simulations. But the person is not a system of algorithms: he or she is a creature, relationship, mystery. Allow me, then, to express a wish: that the journey of the Churches in Italy may include, in real symbiosis with the centrality of Jesus, the anthropological vision as an essential tool of pastoral discernment. Without lively reflection on the human being – in its corporeality, its vulnerability, its thirst for the infinite and capacity for bonding – ethics is reduced to a code and faith risks becoming disembodied. I particularly recommend cultivating a culture of dialogue. It is good for all ecclesial realities - parishes, associations and movements - to be spaces of intergenerational listening, of comparison with different worlds, of caring about words and relationships. Because only where there is listening can communion be born, and only where there is communion does truth become credible. I encourage you to continue on this path! The proclamation of the Gospel, peace, human dignity, dialogue: these are the coordinates through which you can be a Church that incarnates the Gospel and is a sign of the Kingdom of God. In conclusion, I would like to leave you with some exhortations for the near future. In the first place: go forward in unity, thinking especially of the synodal path. The Lord, Saint Augustine writes that the Lord, in order to keep his body well-composed and in peace, exhorts the Church, through the Apostle Paul: The eye cannot say to the hand, I do not need you, nor again the head to the feet, I do not need you. If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were hearing, where would the sense of smell be? Stay united and do not defend yourselves against the provocations of the Spirit. Synodality becomes a mindset, in the heart, in decision-making processes and in ways of acting. Secondly, look to tomorrow with serenity, and do not be afraid to make courageous choices! No-one can prevent you from being close to the people, sharing life, walking with the last, serving the poor. No-one can prevent you from proclaiming the Gospel, and it is the Gospel that we are invited to bring, because it is this that everyone, ourselves first, need in order to live well and to be happy. Take care that the lay faithful, nourished with the Word of God and formed in the social doctrine of the Church, are agents of evangelization in the workplace, in schools, in hospitals, in social and cultural environments, in the economy, and in politics. Dear friends, let us walk together, with joy in our heart and song on our lips. God is greater than our mediocrity: let us allow ourselves to be drawn to Him! Let us trust in his providence. I entrust you all to the protection of Mary Most Holy: Our Lady of Loreto, of Pompeii and of the countless shrines to be found throughout Italy. And I accompany you with my blessing. Thank you.________________________ Holy See Press Office Bulletin, 17 June 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"

Peace be with you! Your Eminence, brothers in the episcopate,dear brothers and sisters! I welcome you with joy, after the beatification of Floribert Bwana Chui. I greet the bishops present, in particular those of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including the bishop of Goma, the diocese where the new Blessed lived. I greet the mother and relatives of Blessed Floribert, as well as the Sant’Egidio Community, to which he belonged. This young man met with martyrdom in Goma on 8 July 007. I remember him with the words of beloved Pope Francis, addressed to the young people of Kinshasa, during his apostolic journey in Congo: “A young person like yourselves, Floribert Bwana Chui … at only twenty-six years old, was killed in Goma for having blocked the passage of spoiled foodstuffs that would have been harmful for people’s health. … Since he was a Christian, he prayed. He thought of others and he chose to be honest, saying no to the filth of corruption. That is what it means to keep your hands clean, for hands that traffic in easy money get stained with blood. … To be honest is to shine like the day; it is to radiate the light of God. It is. To live the beatitude of justice:overcome evil with good!” (2 February 2023). Where did a young man find the strength to resist corruption, rooted in the current mentality and capable of any violence? The choice to keep his hands clean – he was a customs official – matured in a conscience formed by prayer, listening to the Word of God, and communion with his brothers. He lived the spirituality of the Sant’Egidio Community, which Pope Francis summarized in three words beginning with the letter “P”: prayer, the poor, and peace. The poor were decisive in his life. Blessed Floribert lived a family life committed to street children, driven to Goma by war, despised and orphaned. He loved them with Christ’s charity: he was interested in them and concerned with their human and Christian formation. A friend recalls: “He was convinced that we were born to do great things, to make a mark on history, to transform reality”.[1][] He was a man of peace. In a region as troubled as Kivu, torn by violence, he continued his battle for peace with meekness, serving the poor, practicing friendship and encounter in a fractured society. A religious sister recalled that he used to say: “The community puts all peoples at the same table”. This young man, not at all resigned to evil, had a dream, which he nourished with the words of the Gospel and closeness to the Lord. Many young people felt abandoned and hopeless, but Floribert listened to the words of Jesus: “I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you” (Jn14:18). No land is abandoned by God! He invited his friends not to give up, and not to live for themselves. Despite everything, he expressed confidence in the future. He said: “The Lord is preparing a new world, where there will be no more war, hatred will be wiped out, violence will no longer appear like a thief in the night … children will grow up in peace. Yes, it is a great dream. Let us not live, then, for what is not worthy. Rather, let us live for this great dream!”. This African martyr, in a continent rich in young people, shows how they can be a leaven for “disarmed and disarming” peace. This Congolese layperson sheds light on the precious value of the witness of the laity and the young. May then, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary and Blessed Floribert, the longed-for peace in Kivu, Congo and all of Africa soon be reached! Thank you. ___________________________________ [1]The testimonies and words of Blessed Floribert Bwana Chui are taken from thePositio super Martyrio._________________________________ Holy See Press Office Bulletin, 16 June 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,June,To the participants of the Summer School of Astrophysics promoted by the Vatican Observatory (16 June 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/june/documents/20250616-specola.html,"ADDRESS OF THE HOLY FATHERTO THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE SUMMER SCHOOL OF ASTROPHYSICSPROMOTED BY THE VATICAN OBSERVATORY Consistory HallMonday, 16 June 2025 [Multimedia] ___________________________________ Good morning, and welcome! I am pleased to have this opportunity to greet all of you, students and scholars from various part of the world who are taking part in the Vatican Observatory Summer School. I offer you my prayerful good wishes that this experience of living and studying together will not only be academically and personally enriching, but also help to develop friendships and forms of collaboration that can only contribute to the progress of science in the service of our one human family. This year’s Summer School - I am told - is devoted to the theme,Exploring the Universe with the James Webb Space Telescope.Surely, this must be an exciting time to be an astronomer! Thanks to that truly remarkable instrument, for the first time we are able to peer deeply into the atmosphere of exoplanets where life may be developing and study the nebulae where planetary systems themselves are forming. With Webb, we can even trace the ancient light of distant galaxies, which speaks of the very beginning of our universe. The authors of sacred Scripture, writing so many centuries ago, did not have the benefit of this privilege. Yet their poetic and religious imagination pondered what the moment of creation must have been like, when “the stars shone in their watches and rejoiced; and their Creator called them and they said, ‘Here we are!’, shining with gladness for him who made them” (Baruch3:34). In our own day, do not the James Webb images also fill us with wonder, and indeed a mysterious joy, as we contemplate their sublime beauty? The Space Telescope science team has worked hard to make these images available to the general public, for which all of us can be grateful. In a special way, though, all of you who are taking part in the Summer School have been given the knowledge and training that can enable you to use this amazing instrument in order to expand our knowledge of the cosmos of which we are a tiny but meaningful part. Of course, none of you have come to this point all by yourself. Each of you is part of a much greater community. Think of all the people over the last thirty years who worked to build the Space Telescope and its instruments, and those who worked to develop the scientific ideas that it was designed to test.Along with the contribution of your fellow scientists, engineers and mathematicians, it was also with the support of your families and so many of your friends that you have been able to appreciate and take part in this wonderful enterprise, which has enabled us to see the world around us in a new way. Never forget, then, that what you are doing is meant to benefit all of us. Be generous in sharing what you learn and what you experience, as best you can and however you can. Do not hesitate to share the joy and the amazement born of your contemplation of the “seeds” that, in the words of Saint Augustine, God has sown in the harmony of the universe (cf.De Genesis ad Litteram, V, 23, 44-45). The more joy you share, the more joy you create, and in this way, through your pursuit of knowledge, each of you can contribute to building a more peaceful and just world. With these thoughts, my friends, I renew my thanks for your visit and I assure you of my prayers for you, your families and your work and upon all of you, I willingly invoke God’s blessings of wisdom and understanding, of joy and peace. God bless you! [Blessing, in English] Thank you. Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,June,To the Bishops of Madagascar (16 June 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/june/documents/20250616-vescovi-madagascar.html,"ADDRESS OF THE HOLY FATHERTO THE BISHOPS OF MADAGASCAR Hall of PopesMonday, 16 June 2025 [Multimedia] ___________________________________ Your Eminence, Your Excellencies, dear brothers in the episcopate! It is with great joy that I welcome you today at the tomb of the Apostle Peter, pastors of the Church in Madagascar, who have come to Rome on the Jubilee pilgrimage. This meeting has a particular significance for me, because it is our first meeting. I give thanks to the Lord for this occasion of fraternity in Christ. I must also tell you that I admire your decision to come all together to Rome, as bishops of Madagascar. It is a good sign of unity, already agreed with belovedPope Francis, whom we feel spiritually present also at this time. Hevisited your country in 2019, and three years later, he welcomed you on yourad limina Apostolorumvisit. This time it is theJubilee, the year of grace proclaimed by the Lord Jesus, that has brought you here. And it is good that you have become pilgrims of hope, together with the thousands and thousands of faithful who cross the Holy Doors of the papal basilicas every day. You are first and foremost pilgrims of hope for yourselves: you, who are pastors, have remembered that first of all you are sheep in the flock, to whom Christ says: “I am the gate for the sheep. … Whoever enters through me will be saved, and will come in and go out and find pasture” (Jn10:7-9). And at the same time, you have become pilgrims of hope for your people, for families, for the elderly, children, the young; so that the Churches in Madagascar, through you, may receive the grace to walk in the hope that is Jesus Christ. I am pleased to listen to you tell of the joys and the pastoral trials you faithfully bear. Your closeness to the people of God is a living sign of the Gospel. I encourage each one of you, in your episcopal ministry, to take particular care of the priests, who are your first collaborators and your closest brothers, as well as the religious brothers and sisters who spend themselves in service. I give thanks for the missionary vitality of your particular Churches, heirs to the witness of the saints who, to bring the Gospel to that distant land, feared neither refusal nor persecution. I would like to remember Henri de Solages, the first missionary who did not let himself be discouraged by failure and imprisonment, or the martyr saintJacques Berthieu, whose blood was the seed of Christianity in Madagascar. May your example continue to strengthen you in the giving of yourselves to Christ and to his Church, amid the successes and pastoral trials you go through in order to reach the people of God in the various realities of your dioceses! I urge you not to take your eyes off the poor: they are at the centre of the Gospel and are the privileged recipients of the proclamation of the Good News. May you recognize in them the face of Christ, and may your pastoral action always be inspired by a concrete concern for the little ones. May your ministry in this Jubilee, beyond its trials, help them to ignite the ever-new horizons of the hope offered by Christ. FollowingPope Francis, I invite you to take care of our common home, to preserve the beauty of the Great Island, whose beauty and fragility have been entrusted to you. Care for our home is an integral part of your prophetic mission. Take care of creation, which weeps, and teach your faithful the art of protecting it with justice and peace. Dear brothers, continue your service with courage and hope. The Successor of Peter accompanies you with his prayer and his affection. May the Virgin Mary, Our Lady of Madagascar, protect you. May BlessedRaphaël Rafiringa, BlessedVictoire Rasoamanarivo, SaintJacques Berthieuand all the saints of your land intercede for you. I bless you from my heart.__________________________ Holy See Press Office Bulletin, 16 June 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,May,Conclusion of the month of May (31 May 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/may/documents/20250531-conclusione-mesemariano.html,"CONCLUSION OF THE MONTH OF MAY ADDRESS OF THE HOLY FATHER LEO XIV Lourdes Grotto in the Vatican GardensSaturday, 31 May 2025 [Multimedia] ___________________________________ Dear brothers and sisters, With joy, I join you in this prayer Vigil at the conclusion of the Month of May. It is a gesture of faith with which, in a simple and devoted way, we gather under the maternal mantle of Mary. This year, then, it recalls some important aspects of the Jubilee we are celebrating: praise, the journey, hope, and above all, faith contemplated and manifested chorally. You have prayed the Holy Rosary together: prayer, asJohn Paul IIhighlighted, with a Marian appearance and a Christological heart, which “has all the depth of the Gospel message in its entirety” (Apostolic LetterRosarium Virginis Mariae, 16 October 2002, 1). And, in effect, meditating on theJoyful Mysteries, along the way, you entered and stopped, as in a pilgrimage, in many places of the life of Jesus: in the house of Nazareth, contemplating the Annunciation; in that of Zechariah, contemplating the Visitation, which we are celebrating today; in the grotto of Bethlehem, contemplating the Nativity; in the Temple of Jerusalem, contemplating the presentation and then the finding of Jesus. You have been accompanied, in the Hail Mary repeated with faith, by the words of the Angel to the Mother of God: “Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you!” (Lk1:28), and those of Elizabeth who welcomes her with joy: “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!” (Lk1:42). Your stops have thus been cadenced by the Word of God, which has marked, with its rhythm, their progress, stops and departures, just as it was for the people of Israel in the desert, on the journey towards the promised Land. Let us look, then, at our existence as a journey following Jesus, to be travelled, as we have done this evening, together with Mary. And let us ask the Lord to be able to praise him every day, “with our lives and our tongues, with hearts and mouths, with our voices and our behaviour” (Saint Augustine,Sermon 256, 1), avoiding discord: the tongue in harmony with life and the mouth with the conscience (cf.ibid.). I greet the Cardinals present, the bishops, the priests, the consecrated persons and all the faithful. I wish to express, in particular, my affection and gratitude to the Benedictine Sisters of theMater EcclesiaeMonastery, who support our community and our work with their hidden and constant prayer. May the joy of this moment remain and grow in us, “in our personal and family lives, in every environment, especially in the life of this family which here in the Vatican serves the universal Church” (Benedict XVI,Conclusion of the Month of May, 31 May 2012). May the Lord bless us and accompany us always, and may Mary intercede for us. Thank you! _______________________ Holy See Press Office Bulletin, 31 May 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,May,To the Members of the Popular Movements for Peace (30 May 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/may/documents/20250530-movimenti-pace.html,"ADDRESS OF HIS HOLINESS POPE LEO XIVTO THE MOVEMENTS AND ASSOCIATIONS OF THE “ARENA OF PEACE” (VERONA) Clementine HallFriday, 30 May 2025 [Multimedia] ___________________________________ Dear brothers and sisters, peace be with you! I am pleased to welcome you, members of the Movements and Associations of the “Arena of Peace.”A year ago, you launched the great “Arena of Peace” event in Verona, withPope Francisin attendance. In a particular way, I would like to thank Bishop Domenico Pompili of Verona and the Comboni Fathers. On that occasion, the Pope stated once again that building peace starts by standing alongside victims and seeing things from their point of view. This approach is essential for disarming hearts, approaches and mentalities, and for denouncing the injustices of a system that kills and is based on the throwaway culture. How can we forget the courageous embrace between Maoz Inon, an Israeli whose parents were killed by Hamas, and Aziz Sarah, a Palestinian whose brother was killed by the Israeli army. They are now friends and work with one another. That gesture remains as a testimony and sign of hope. We thank them for being here today. The path to peace demands hearts and minds trained in concern for others and capable of perceiving the common good in today’s world. For the road to peace involves everyone and leads to the fostering of right relationships between all living beings. AsJohn Paul IIpointed out, peace is an indivisible good; it is either everyone’s or no one’s (cf.Sollicitudo rei socialis, 26). It can truly be attained and enjoyed as a reality of life and integral development only if there exists in people’s consciences “a firm and persevering determination to commit oneself to the common good” (ibid., 38). In an age like our own, marked by speed and immediacy, we need to recover the patience required for this process to occur. History and practical experience have taught us that authentic peace takes shape from the ground up, beginning with places, communities and local institutions, and by listening to what they have to tell us. In this way, we come to realize that peace is possible when disagreements and the conflicts they entail are not set aside, but acknowledged, understood and surmounted. That is why your work as popular movements and associations is especially valuable. Through concrete action “from below,” in dialogue with all parties and with the creativity and ingenuity born of a culture of peace, you are pursuing projects and activities at the concrete service of individuals and the common good. In this way, you generate hope. Dear brothers and sisters, all too much violence exists in the world and our societies. Amid wars, terrorism, human trafficking and widespread aggression, our children and young people need to be able to experience the culture of life, dialogue, and mutual respect. Above all, they need the witness of men and women who embody a different and non-violent way of living. From local and everyday situations up to the international order, whenever those who have suffered injustice and violence resist the temptation to seek revenge, they become the most credible agents of non-violent peacebuilding processes. Non-violence, as a method and a style, must distinguish our decisions, our relationships and our actions. The Gospel and the Church’s social doctrine are a constant source of support for Christians in this effort. They can also act as a compass for everyone, since the fostering of a culture of peace is a task entrusted to all, believers and non-believers alike, who must advance it through reflection and a praxis inspired by the dignity of the person and the common good. If you want peace, prepare institutions of peace. Increasingly we realize that this cannot simply involve political institutions, whether national or international, but requires all institutions – educational, economic and social. The EncyclicalFratelli Tuttifrequently spoke of the need to pass from “I” to “we”, in a spirit of solidarity that needs to find institutional expression. For this reason, I encourage you to remain committed and present: present within history as a leaven of unity, communion and fraternity. Fraternity needs to be recovered, loved, experienced, proclaimed and witnessed, in the confident hope that it is indeed possible, thanks to the love of God “poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit” (Rom5:5). Dear friends, I thank you for your presence today. I pray for you, that you may continue to work with patient perseverance. I accompany all of you with my blessing.

NAPOLI FOOTBALL TEAM Clementine HallTuesday, 27 May 2025 [Multimedia] __________________________________________ Perhaps they didn’t want to applaud, because in the press it is said that I am a Rome fan… but welcome! This is what the press says. Not everything you read in the press is true! Dear friends, Welcome! And congratulations for your victory in the Championship! It is a great celebration for the city of Naples! And it is precisely on this that I would like to reflect with you. To win the Championship is a milestone that one reaches at the end of a long journey, where what counts the most is not the one-off exploit, or the extraordinary performance of a champion. The Championship is won by the team, and when I say “team”, I mean the players, the trainer with the entire team, and the sports association. Therefore, I am truly happy to welcome you now, to highlight this aspect of your success, which I consider the most important. And I would say that it is so also from a social point of view. We know how popular football is in Italy, and practically all over the world. And so, from this perspective, it seems to me that the social value of an event like this, which goes beyond the merely technical and sporting fact, is the example of a team – in the broadest sense – working together, in which the talents of the individuals are placed at the service of the whole. And there is one last thing it is important to me to say, taking advantage of this occasion. It regards the educational aspect. Unfortunately, when sport becomes a business, it risks losing the values that make it educational, and can even become anti-educational. It is necessary to keep a lookout for this, especially with regard to teenagers. I appeal to parents and sports managers: we must be very careful of the moral quality of the experience of sport at competitive level, because the human growth of the young is at stake. I think we understand each other, and there is no need for many words. I thank you for your visit. And congratulations again! Congratulations also from a lady who is cooking for me in these days, and who is from Naples, and says to you: best wishes! She would like to be here too, Mrs. Rosa, who is a big fan! May the Lord bless you all and your families. All the best! ____________________________________ Holy See Press Office Bulletin, 27 May 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"

You can be seated, but I will stand. I just came very briefly to greet all of you and to welcome you to Rome, to the Vatican, to Saint Peter’s Basilica, and to join you very briefly in this Jubilee pilgrimage during this Holy Year, a year which inspires us all and invites us all to look for hope, but also to be signs of hope. How important it is that each and every baptized person feel himself or herself to be called by God to be a sign of hope in the world today. It is our faith that gives us strength. It is our faith that enables us to see the light of Jesus Christ in our lives and to understand how important it is to live our faith. Not only on Sundays, not only during a pilgrimage, but each and every day so that we will be filled with the hope that only Jesus Christ can give us and that all of us together will continue to walk united as brothers and sisters to praise our God; to recognize that everything we have and everything we are is a gift from God, and to place those gifts at the service of others. I am very happy to be able to greet you all for just a very brief moment this afternoon, but to say to each and every one of you: Thank you for living your life, your faith in Jesus Christ. You are already very well accompanied by their Eminences, Cardinal Turkson, Cardinal Arinze, as well as Archbishop Fortunatus, and all of us together, filled with the great witness that you are all giving and that the continent of Africa gives to the whole world.

Together with you, I thank the civic administration, as well as the civil and military authorities, on the day of my inauguration as Bishop of Rome. As I officially undertake the ministry of Pastor of this diocese, I feel the grave but exciting responsibility to serve all its members, having at heart first and foremost the faith of the people of God and therefore the common good of society. For this latter purpose we are collaborators, each one in his own institutional sphere. Just after the election, I reminded the brothers and sisters gathered in Saint Peter’s Square that I am Christian with them and bishop for them: in a special way, today I can say that for you and with you I am Roman! For two millennia the Church has been practising her apostolate in Rome, proclaiming Christ’s Gospel and working in charity. The education of the young and assistance to those who are suffering, dedication to the lowliest and the fostering of the arts are expressions of that care for human dignity that we must support in every time, especially towards the small, the weak and the poor. In the holy year of the Jubilee, this concern is extended to pilgrims from every part of the world, and it also benefits from the profuse commitment of the Capitoline administration, for which I express my keen gratitude. Lord Mayor, I hope that Rome, incomparable for the wealth of her historic and artistic heritage, may also always be distinguished for those values of humanity and civilization that draw their lifeblood from the Gospel. With these sentiments, I impart my Apostolic Blessing upon this city and all her inhabitants. ___________________________________ Holy See Press Office Bulletin, 25 May 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,May,Meeting of the Holy Father with Employees of the Holy See and the Vatican City State (24 May 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/may/documents/20250524-dipendenti-curia-scv.html,"MEETING OF THE HOLY FATHER WITH EMPLOYEES OF THE HOLY SEE AND THE VATICAN CITY STATE ADDRESS OF THE HOLY FATHER Audience HallSaturday, 24 May 2025 [Multimedia] ___________________________________ Thank you! When the applause lasts longer than the address, I will have to make a longer address! So… be careful! Thank you! Thank you! In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, peace be with you. Dear brothers and sisters! I am glad to be able to greet all of you who form the working communities of the Roman Curia, the Governorate and the Vicariate of Rome. I greet the Heads of the Dicasteries and the other Superiors, the Office Heads and all the officials, as well as the authorities of Vatican City, the managers and the employees. And I am very happy that many family members are also present, taking advantage of the Saturday. This first meeting of ours is certainly not the moment to make keynote speeches, but rather it is an opportunity for me to thank you for the service you carry out, and this service that I have, so to speak, “inherited” from my predecessors. Thank you indeed. Yes, as you know, I arrived only two years ago, when our beloved Pope Francis appointed me as Prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops. Then I left the diocese of Chiclayo, in Peru, and came to work here. What a change! And now, then… What can I say? Only what Simon Peter said to Jesus on Lake Tiberias: “Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you” (Jn21:17). Popes pass, the Curia remains. This applies to every particular Church, for the episcopal Curias. And it also applies to the Curia of the Bishop of Rome. The Curia is the institution that preserves and transmits the historical memory of a Church, of the ministry of its bishops. This is very important. Memory is an essential element in a living organism. It is not only directed to the past, but nourishes the present and guides the future. Without memory, the path is lost, it loses its sense of direction. Here, dear friends, is the first thought I would like to share with you: to work in the Roman Curia means to contribute to keeping the memory of the Apostolic See alive, in the vital sense I have just mentioned, so that the Pope’s ministry may be implemented in the best way. And, by analogy, this can also be said of the services of Vatican City State. Then, there is another aspect I would like to recall, complementary to that of memory, that is themissionarydimension of the Church and of every institution linked to the Petrine ministry. This was insisted upon a great deal byPope Franciswho, consistently with the project laid out in the Apostolic ExhortationEvangelii gaudium, reformed the Roman Curia from the perspective of evangelization, with the Apostolic ConstitutionPraedicate Evangelium. And he did this by following in the footsteps of his predecessors, especiallySaint Paul VIandSaint John Paul II. As I think you know, the experience of mission forms part of my life, and not only as a baptized person, as for all us Christians, but because as an Augustinian religious I was a missionary in Peru, and in the midst of the Peruvian people my pastoral vocation matured. I will never be able to thank the Lord enough for this gift! Then, the call to serve the Church here in the Roman Curia was a new mission, which I shared with you during these last two years. And still I continue it and will continue it, as long as God wills, in this service that has been entrusted to me. Therefore, I repeat to you what I said inmy first greeting, in the evening of 8 May: “Together, we must look for ways to be a missionary Church, a Church that builds bridges and encourages dialogue, a Church ever open to welcoming… with open arms, all those who are in need of our charity, our presence, our readiness to dialogue and our love”. These words were addressed to the Church of Rome. And now I repeat them, thinking of the mission of this Church towards all the Churches and the entire world, of serving communion, unity, in charity and in truth. The Lord gave this task to Peter and his successors, and you all collaborate in different ways in this great task. Each one of you gives your contribution, carrying out your daily work with commitment and also with faith, because faith and prayer are like salt for food; they impart flavour. If, then, we must all cooperate in the great cause of unity and love, let us seek to do so first of all with our behaviour in everyday situations, starting also from the work environment. Each person can be a builder of unity with his attitudes towards colleagues, overcoming inevitable misunderstandings with patience, with humility, putting himself in the shoes of others, avoiding prejudices, and also with a good dose of humour, asPope Francistaught us. Dear brothers and sisters, thank you again from the bottom of my heart! We are in the month of May: let us invoke the Virgin Mary together, so that she may bless the Roman Curia and Vatican City, and also your families, especially children, the elderly and the sick and suffering. Thank you! So, let us say together: “Hail Mary…” [Blessing] Thank you once again, best wishes!  __________________________ Holy See Press Office Bulletin, 24 May 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,May,To Members of Pontifical Mission Societies (22 May 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/may/documents/20250522-pom.html,"ADDRESS OF THE HOLY FATHERTOPONTIFICAL MISSION SOCIETIES Clementine HallThursday, 22 May 2025 [Multimedia] ___________________________________ Your Eminence, Your Excellencies,General Secretaries, National Directors and Personnelof the Pontifical Mission Societies,Dear brothers and sisters, I offer a warm welcome to all of you, who have gathered from over one hundred and twenty countries to take part in the annual General Assembly of thePontifical Mission Societies. I want to begin by expressing my gratitude to you and your associates for your dedicated service, which is indispensable to the Church’s mission of evangelization, as I can personally attest from my own pastoral experience in the years of my ministry serving in Peru. ThePontifical Mission Societiesare effectively the “primary means” of awakening missionary responsibility among all the baptized and supporting ecclesial communities in areas where the Church is young (cf. DecreeAd Gentes, 38). We see this in the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, which provides aid for pastoral and catechetical programmes, the building of new churches, healthcare, and educational needs in mission territories. The Society of the Holy Childhood, too, provides support for Christian formation programmes for children, in addition to caring for their basic needs and protection. Likewise, the Society of Saint Peter the Apostle helps to cultivate missionary vocations, priestly and religious, while the Missionary Union is committed to forming priests, religious men and women, and all the people of God for the Church’s missionary activity. The promotion of apostolic zeal among the People of God remains an essential aspect of the Church’s renewal as envisioned by theSecond Vatican Council, and is all the more urgent in our own day. Our world, wounded by war, violence and injustice, needs to hear the Gospel message of God’s love and to experience the reconciling power of Christ’s grace. In this sense, the Church herself, in all her members, is increasingly called to be “a missionary Church that opens its arms to the world, proclaims the word … and becomes a leaven of harmony for humanity” (Homily, Mass for the Beginning of the Pontificate, 18 May 2025). We are to bring to all peoples, indeed to all creatures, the Gospel promise of true and lasting peace, which is possible because, in the words of Pope Francis, “the Lord has overcome the world and its constant conflict ‘by making peace through the blood of his cross’” (Evangelii Gaudium, 229). Hence we see the importance of fostering a spirit of missionary discipleship in all the baptized and a sense of the urgency of bringing Christ to all people. In this regard, I would like to thank you and your associates for your efforts each year in promoting World Mission Sunday on the second-to-last Sunday of October, which is of immense help to me in my solicitude for the Churches in areas which are under the care of theDicastery for Evangelization. Today, as in the days after Pentecost, the Church, led by the Holy Spirit, pursues her journey through history with trust, joy and courage as she proclaims the name of Jesus and the salvation born of faith in the saving truth of the Gospel.The Pontifical Mission Societiesare an important part of this great effort. In their work of coordinating missionary formation and animating a missionary spirit on the local level, I would ask the National Directors to give priority to visiting dioceses, parishes and communities, and in this way to help the faithful to recognize the fundamental importance of the missions and supporting our brothers and sisters in those areas of our world where the Church is young and growing. Before concluding these words with you this morning, I would like to reflect with you on two distinctive elements of your identity asPontifical Mission Societies. They can be described as, communion and universality. As Societies committed to sharing in the missionary mandate of the Pope and the College of Bishops, you are called to cultivate and further promote within your members the vision of the Church as the communion of believers, enlivened by the Holy Spirit, who enables us to enter into the perfect communion and harmony of the blessed Trinity. Indeed, it is in the Trinity that all things find their unity. This dimension of our Christian life and mission is close to my heart, and is reflected in the words of Saint Augustine that I chose for my episcopal service and now for my papal ministry: In Illo uno unum. Christ is our Saviour and in him we are one, a family of God, beyond the rich variety of our languages, cultures and experiences. The appreciation of our communion as members of the Body of Christ naturally opens us to the universal dimension of the Church’s mission of evangelization, and inspires us to transcend the confines of our individual parishes, dioceses and nations, in order to share with every nation and people the surpassing richness of the knowledge of Jesus Christ (cf.Phil 3:8). A renewed focus on the Church’s unity and universality corresponds precisely to the authentic charism of thePontifical Mission Societies. As such, it should inspire the process of renewal of the statutes that you have initiated. In this regard, I express my trust that this process will confirm the members of the Societies worldwide in their vocation to be a leaven of missionary zeal within the People of God. Dear friends, our celebration of thisHoly Yearchallenges all of us to be “pilgrims of hope.”  Taking up the words that Pope Francis chose as the theme for this year’sWorld Mission Day, I would conclude by encouraging you to continue to be “missionaries of hope among all peoples.” Commending you, your benefactors and all associated with your important work to the loving intercession of Mary, the Mother of the Church, I cordially impart my Apostolic Blessing as a pledge of lasting joy and peace in the Lord.

I express fraternal affection to His All Holiness Bartholomew, His Beatitude Theophilos III and His Holiness Mar Awa III, and to each of you I am deeply grateful for your presence and prayers, which are a great comfort and encouragement. One of the strong emphases of PopeFrancis’ pontificate was that of universal fraternity. In this regard the Holy Spirit really “urged” him to advance with great strides the initiatives already undertaken by previous Pontiffs, especially since SaintJohn XXIII.The Pope ofFratelli Tuttipromoted both the ecumenical path and interreligious dialogue. He did so above all by cultivating interpersonal relations, in such a way that, without taking anything away from ecclesial bonds, the human trait of the encounter was always valued. May God help us to treasure his witness! My election has taken place during the year of the 1700th anniversary of the First Ecumenical Council of Nicaea. That Council represents a milestone in the formulation of the Creed shared by all Churches and Ecclesial Communities. While we are on the journey to re-establishing full communion among all Christians, we recognise that this unity can only be unity in faith. As Bishop of Rome, I consider one of my priorities to be that of seeking the re-establishment of full and visible communion among all those who profess the same faith in God the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Indeed, unity has always been a constant concern of mine, as witnessed by the motto I chose for my episcopal ministry:In Illo uno unum, an expression of Saint Augustine of Hippo that reminds us how we too, although we are many, “in the One — that is Christ — we are one” (Enarr. in Ps., 127, 3). What is more, our communion is realised to the extent that we meet in the Lord Jesus. The more faithful and obedient we are to him, the more united we are among ourselves. We Christians, then, are all called to pray and work together to reach this goal, step by step, which is and remains the work of the Holy Spirit. Aware, moreover, that synodality and ecumenism are closely linked, I would like to assure you of my intention to continue PopeFrancis’commitment to promoting the synodal nature of the Catholic Church and developing new and concrete forms for an ever stronger synodality in ecumenical relations. Our common path can and must also be understood in the broad sense of involving everyone, in the spirit of human fraternity that I mentioned above. Now is the time for dialogue and building bridges. I am therefore pleased and grateful for the presence of representatives of other religious traditions, who share the search for God and his will, which is always and only the will of love and life for men and women and for all creatures. You have witnessed the remarkable efforts made by PopeFrancisin favour of interreligious dialogue. Through his words and actions, he opened new avenues of encounter, to promote “the culture of dialogue as the path; mutual collaboration as the code of conduct; reciprocal understanding as the method and standard” (ADocument on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together, Abu Dhabi, 4 February 2019). I thank theDicastery for Interreligious Dialoguefor the essential role it plays in this patient work of encouraging meetings and concrete exchanges aimed at building relationships based on human fraternity. In a special way I greet our Jewish and Muslim brothers and sisters. Because of the Jewish roots of Christianity, all Christians have a special relationship with Judaism. The conciliar DeclarationNostra Aetate(no. 4) emphasises the greatness of the spiritual heritage shared by Christians and Jews, encouraging mutual knowledge and esteem. The theological dialogue between Christians and Jews remains ever important and close to my heart. Even in these difficult times, marked by conflicts and misunderstandings, it is necessary to continue the momentum of this precious dialogue of ours. Relations between the Catholic Church and Muslims have been marked by a growing commitment to dialogue and fraternity, fostered by esteem for these our brothers and sisters who “worship God, who is one, living and subsistent, merciful and almighty, the Creator of heaven and earth, who has also spoken to humanity” (ibid., 3). This approach, based on mutual respect and freedom of conscience, is a solid foundation for building bridges between our communities. To all of you, representatives of other religious traditions, I express my gratitude for your participation in this meeting and for your contribution to peace. In a world wounded by violence and conflict, each of the communities represented here brings its own contribution of wisdom, compassion and commitment to the good of humanity and the preservation of our common home. I am convinced that if we are in agreement, and free from ideological and political conditioning, we can be effective in saying “no” to war and “yes” to peace, “no” to the arms race and “yes” to disarmament, “no” to an economy that impoverishes peoples and the Earth and “yes” to integral development. The witness of our fraternity, which I hope we will be able to show with effective gestures, will certainly contribute to building a more peaceful world, something that all men and women of good will desire in their hearts. Dear friends, thank you again for your closeness. Let us ask for God’s blessing in our hearts: may his infinite goodness and wisdom help us to live as his children and as brothers and sisters to each other, so that hope may grow in the world. I offer you my heartfelt gratitude. Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"

Dear brothers and sisters, welcome! I thank the President and members of theCentesimus Annus Pro PontificeFoundation, and I greet all of you who are taking part in this annual International Conference and General Assembly. The theme of this year’s Conference – “Overcoming Polarizations and Rebuilding Global Governance: The Ethical Foundations” – speaks to us of the deepest purpose of the Church’s social doctrine as a contribution to peace and dialogue in the service of building bridges of universal fraternity. Especially in this Easter season, we realize that the Risen Lord always goes before us, even at times when injustice and death seem to prevail. Let us help one another, as I said on the evening of my election, “to build bridges through dialogue and encounter, joining together as one people, always at peace.” This is not something that happens by chance, but is rather an active and continuous interplay of grace and freedom, one that our meeting today seeks to respect and support. PopeLeo XIII, who lived in an age of momentous and disruptive change, sought to promote peace by encouraging social dialogue between capital and labour, technology and human intelligence, and different political cultures and nations.Pope Francisspoke of a “polycrisis” in describing the dramatic nature of our own age, marked by wars, climate change, growing inequalities, forced and contested migration, stigmatized poverty, disruptive technological innovations, job insecurity and precarious labour rights (Message to Participants in the General Assembly of the Pontifical Academy for Life, 3 March 2025). On such important issues, the Church’s social doctrine is called to provide insights that facilitate dialogue between science and conscience, and thus make an essential contribution to better understanding, hope and peace. This doctrine helps us to realize that more important than our problems or eventual solutions is the way we approach them, guided by criteria of discernment, sound ethical principles and openness to God’s grace. You have the opportunity to show that the Church’s social doctrine, with its specific anthropological approach, seeks to encourage genuine engagement with social issues. It does not claim to possess a monopoly on truth, either in its analysis of problems or its proposal of concrete solutions. Where social questions are concerned, knowing how best to approach them is more important than providing immediate responses to why things happen or how to deal with them. The aim is to learn how to confront problems, for these are always different, since every generation is new, and faces new challenges, dreams and questions. This is a fundamental aspect of our attempts to build a “culture of encounter” through dialogue and social friendship. For many of our contemporaries, the words “dialogue” and “doctrine” can seem incompatible. Perhaps when we hear the word “doctrine,” we tend to think of a set of ideas belonging to a religion. The word itself makes us feel less disposed to reflect, call things into question or seek new alternatives. In the case of the Church’s social doctrine, we need to make clear that the word “doctrine” has another, more positive meaning, without which dialogue itself would be meaningless. “Doctrine” can be a synonym of “science,” “discipline” and “knowledge.” Understood in this way, doctrine appears as the product of research, and hence of hypotheses, discussions, progress and setbacks, all aimed at conveying a reliable, organized and systematic body of knowledge about a given issue. Consequently, a doctrine is not the same as an opinion, but is rather a common, collective and even multidisciplinary pursuit of truth. “Indoctrination” is immoral. It stifles critical judgement and undermines the sacred freedom ofconscience, even if erroneous. It resists new notions and rejects movement, change or the evolution of ideas in the face of new problems. “Doctrine,” on the other hand, as a serious, serene and rigorous discourse, aims to teach us primarily how to approach problems and, even more importantly, how to approach people. It also helps us to make prudential judgements when confronted with challenges. Seriousness, rigour and serenity are what we must learn from every doctrine, including the Church’s social doctrine. In the context of the ongoing digital revolution, we must rediscover, emphasize and cultivate our duty to train others in critical thinking, countering temptations to the contrary, which can also be found in ecclesial circles. There is so little dialogue around us; shouting often replaces it, not infrequently in the form of fake news and irrational arguments proposed by a few loud voices. Deeper reflection and study are essential, as well as a commitment to encounter and listen to the poor, who are a treasure for the Church and for humanity. Their viewpoints, though often disregarded, are vital if we are to see the world through God’s eyes. Those born and raised far from the centers of power should not merely be taught the Church’s social doctrine; they should also be recognized as carrying it forward and putting it into practice. Individuals committed to the betterment of society, popular movements and the various Catholic workers’ groups are an expression of those existential peripheries where hope endures and springs anew. I urge you to let the voice of the poor be heard. Dear friends, as theSecond Vatican Councilstates, “in every age, the Church carries the responsibility of reading the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel, if she is to carry out her task. In language intelligible to every generation, she should be able to answer the ever-recurring questions which people ask about the meaning of this present life and of the life to come, and how one is related to the other” (Gaudium et Spes, 4). I invite you, then, to participate actively and creatively in this discernment process, and thus contribute, with all of God’s people, to the development of the Church’s social doctrine in this age of significant social changes, listening to everyone and engaging in dialogue with all. In our day, there is a widespread thirst for justice, a desire for authentic fatherhood and motherhood, a profound longing for spirituality, especially among young people and the marginalized, who do not always find effective means of making their needs known. There is a growing demand for the Church’s social doctrine, to which we need to respond. I thank all of you for your commitment and for your prayers for my ministry, and I cordially bless you and your families, and all that you do. Thank you!

2025,May,To Members of the Diplomatic Corps (16 May 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/may/documents/20250516-corpo-diplomatico.html,"AUDIENCE TO MEMBERS OF THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS ACCREDITED TO THE HOLY SEE AUDIENCE OF THE HOLY FATHER LEO XIV Clementine HallFriday, 16 May 2025 [Multimedia] ___________________________________ Your Eminence,Your Excellencies,Ladies and Gentlemen, Peace be with you! I thank His Excellency Mr George Poulides, Ambassador of the Republic of Cyprus and Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, for his cordial greeting in your name, and for the tireless work that he has carried out with his characteristic energy, commitment and kindness. These qualities have earned him the esteem of all my predecessors whom he has met in these years of his mission to the Holy See, particularly the latePope Francis. I would also like to express my gratitude for your many messages of good wishes following my election, as well as those expressing condolence for the death ofPope Francis. Some of those messages also came from countries with which the Holy See does not have diplomatic relations, a significant sign of esteem that indicates a strengthening of mutual relations. In our dialogue, I would like us always to preserve the sense of being a family. Indeed, the diplomatic community represents the entire family of peoples, a family that shares the joys and sorrows of life and the human and spiritual values that give it meaning and direction. Papal diplomacy is an expression of the very catholicity of the Church. In its diplomatic activity, the Holy See is inspired by a pastoral outreach that leads it not to seek privileges but to strengthen its evangelical mission at the service of humanity. Resisting all forms of indifference, it appeals to consciences, as witnessed by the constant efforts of my venerable predecessor, ever attentive to the cry of the poor, the needy and the marginalized, as well as to contemporary challenges, ranging from the protection of creation to artificial intelligence. In addition to being a visible sign of your countries’ respect for the Apostolic See, your presence here today is a gift for me. It allows me to renew the Church’s aspiration — and my own — to reach out and embrace all individuals and peoples on the Earth, who need and yearn for truth, justice and peace! In a certain sense, my own life experience, which has spanned North America, South America and Europe, has been marked by this aspiration to transcend borders in order to encounter different peoples and cultures. Through the constant and patient work of the Secretariat of State, I intend to strengthen understanding and dialogue with you and with your countries, many of which I have already had the grace to visit, especially during my time as Prior General of the Augustinians. I trust that God’s providence will allow me further occasions to get to know the countries from which you come and enable me to have occasions to confirm in the faith our many brothers and sisters throughout the world and to build new bridges with all people of good will. In our dialogue, I would like us to keep in mind three essential words that represent the pillars of the Church’s missionary activity and the aim of the Holy See’s diplomacy. The first word ispeace. All too often we consider it a “negative” word, indicative only of the absence of war and conflict, since opposition is a perennial part of human nature, frequently leading us to live in a constant “state of conflict” at home, at work and in society. Peace then appears simply as a respite, a pause between one dispute and another, given that, no matter how hard we try, tensions will always be present, a little like embers burning beneath the ashes, ready to ignite at any moment. From a Christian perspective – but also in other religious traditions – peace is first and foremost a gift. It is the first gift of Christ: “My peace I give to you” (Jn14:27). Yet it is an active and demanding gift. It engages and challenges each of us, regardless of our cultural background or religious affiliation, demanding first of all that we work on ourselves. Peace is built in the heart and from the heart, by eliminating pride and vindictiveness and carefully choosing our words. For words too, not only weapons, can wound and even kill. In this regard, I believe that religions and interreligious dialogue can make a fundamental contribution to fostering a climate of peace. This naturally requires full respect for religious freedom in every country, since religious experience is an essential dimension of the human person. Without it, it is difficult, if not impossible, to bring about the purification of the heart necessary for building peaceful relationships. This effort, in which all of us are called to take part, can begin to eliminate the root causes of all conflicts and every destructive urge for conquest. It demands a genuine willingness to engage in dialogue, inspired by the desire to communicate rather than clash. As a result, there is a need to give new life to multilateral diplomacy and to those international institutions conceived and designed primarily to remedy eventual disputes within the international community. Naturally, there must also be a resolve to halt the production of instruments of destruction and death, since, as Pope Francis noted inhis lastUrbi et OrbiMessage: No peace is “possible without true disarmament [and] the requirement that every people provide for its own defence must not turn into a race to rearmament.”[1] The second word isjustice. Working for peace requires acting justly. As I have already mentioned, I chose my name thinking first of all ofLeo XIII, the Pope of the first great social Encyclical,Rerum Novarum. In this time of epochal change, the Holy See cannot fail to make its voice heard in the face of the many imbalances and injustices that lead, not least, to unworthy working conditions and increasingly fragmented and conflict-ridden societies. Every effort should be made to overcome the global inequalities – between opulence and destitution – that are carving deep divides between continents, countries and even within individual societies. It is the responsibility of government leaders to work to build harmonious and peaceful civil societies. This can be achieved above all by investing in the family, founded upon the stable union between a man and a woman, “a small but genuine society, and prior to all civil society.”[2]In addition, no one is exempted from striving to ensure respect for the dignity of every person, especially the most frail and vulnerable, from the unborn to the elderly, from the sick to the unemployed, citizens and immigrants alike. My own story is that of a citizen, the descendant of immigrants, who in turn chose to emigrate. All of us, in the course of our lives, can find ourselves healthy or sick, employed or unemployed, living in our native land or in a foreign country, yet our dignity always remains unchanged: it is the dignity of a creature willed and loved by God. The third word istruth. Truly peaceful relationships cannot be built, also within the international community, apart from truth. Where words take on ambiguous and ambivalent connotations, and the virtual world, with its altered perception of reality, takes over unchecked, it is difficult to build authentic relationships, since the objective and real premises of communication are lacking. For her part, the Church can never be exempted from speaking the truth about humanity and the world, resorting whenever necessary to blunt language that may initially create misunderstanding. Yet truth can never be separated from charity, which always has at its root a concern for the life and well-being of every man and woman. Furthermore, from the Christian perspective, truth is not the affirmation of abstract and disembodied principles, but an encounter with the person of Christ himself, alive in the midst of the community of believers. Truth, then, does not create division, but rather enables us to confront all the more resolutely the challenges of our time, such as migration, the ethical use of artificial intelligence and the protection of our beloved planet Earth. These are challenges that require commitment and cooperation on the part of all, since no one can think of facing them alone. Dear Ambassadors, My ministry has begun in the heart of aJubilee Year, devoted in a particular way to hope. It is a time of conversion and renewal and, above all, an opportunity to leave conflicts behind and embark on a new path, confident that, by working together, each of us in accordance with his or her own sensibilities and responsibilities, can build a world in which everyone can lead an authentically human life in truth, justice and peace. It is my hope that this will be the case everywhere, starting with those places that suffer most grievously, like Ukraine and the Holy Land. I thank you for all the work you are doing to build bridges between your countries and the Holy See, and I cordially impart my blessing to you, your families and your peoples. Thank you! Thank you for all the work that you do! ____________________________________________ [1]FRANCIS,Urbi et OrbiMessage, 20 April 2025. [2]LEO XIII, EncyclicalRerum Novarum, 15 May 1891, 9.

2025,May,To the Brothers of the Christian Schools (15 May 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/may/documents/20250515-fratelli-scuole-cristiane.html,"ADDRESS OF THE HOLY FATHER LEO XIVTO THE BROTHERS OF THE CHRISTIAN SCHOOLS Clementine HallThursday, 15 May 2025[Multimedia]___________________________________ In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, peace be with you. Your Eminence,Dear brothers and sisters, welcome! I am very pleased to receive you, in the third centenary of the promulgation of the BullIn apostolicae Dignitatis solio, with whichPope Benedict XIIIapproved your Institute and your Regulations (26 January 1725). It also coincides with the 75thanniversary of the proclamation, byPope Pius XII, of Saint John Baptist de La Salle as “Heavenly patron of all educators” (cf. Apostolic LetterQuod ait, 15 May 1950:AAS12, 1950, 631-632). After three centuries, it is good to see how your presence continues to bear the freshness of a rich and vast educational entity, with which, in various parts of the world, you still dedicate yourselves to the formation of the young with enthusiasm, fidelity and a spirit of sacrifice. Precisely in the light of this anniversary, I would like to pause and reflect with you on two aspects of your history that I consider important for all of us:attention to current eventsand theministerial and missionary dimension of teachingin the community. The beginnings of your work say a great deal about “current events”. Saint John Baptist de La Salle began by responding to the request for help from a layperson, Adriano Nyel, who was struggling to maintain his “school of the poor”. Your founder recognized in his request for help a sign of God; he accepted the challenge and set to work. Thus, beyond his own intentions and expectations, he brought to life to a new teaching system: that of the Christian Schools, free and open to everyone. Among the innovative elements he introduced in this pedagogical revolution were the teaching of classes and no longer of individual pupils; instead of Latin, the adoption of French as the language of instruction, which was accessible to all; Sunday lessons, in which even young people forced to work on weekdays were able to participate; and the involvement of families in the school curriculum, according to the principle of the “educational triangle”, which is still valid today. Thus, problems, as they arose, instead of discouraging him, stimulated him to seek creative answers and to venture onto new and often unexplored paths. All this can but make us think, and it also raises useful questions. What, in the world of youth today, are the most urgent challenges to be faced? What values are to be promoted? What resources can be counted on? Young people of our time, like those of every age, are a volcano of life, energy, sentiments and ideas. It can be seen from the wonderful things they are able to do, in so many fields. However, they also need help in order for this great wealth to grow in harmony, and to overcome what, albeit in a different way to the past, can still hinder their healthy development. While, for example, in the seventeenth century the use of the Latin language was an insuperable barrier to communication for many people, today there are other obstacles to be faced. Think of the isolation caused by rampant relational models increasingly marked by superficiality, individualism and emotional instability; the spread of patterns of thought weakened by relativism; and the prevalence of rhythms and lifestyles in which there is not enough room for listening, reflection and dialogue, at school, in the family, and sometimes among peers themselves, with consequent loneliness. These are demanding challenges, but we too, like Saint John Baptist de La Salle, can turn them into springboards to explore ways, develop tools and adopt new languages to continue to touch the hearts of pupils, helping them and spurring them on to face every obstacle with courage in order to give the best of themselves in life, according to God’s plans. In this sense, the attention you pay, in your schools, to the training of teachers and to the creation of educating communities in which the teaching effort is enriched by the contribution of all is commendable. I encourage you to continue along these paths. But I would like to point out another aspect of the Lasallian reality that I consider important:teachinglived asministryand mission, asconsecrationin the Church. Saint John Baptist de La Salle did not want there to be priests among the teachers of the Christian Schools, but only “brothers”, so that all your efforts would be directed, with God’s help, to the education of the pupils. He loved to say: “Your altar is the cathedra”, thus promoting a reality hitherto unknown in the Church of his time: that oflayteachers and catechists, invested in the community with a genuine “ministry”, in accordance with the principle of evangelizing by educating, and educating by evangelizing (cf. Francis,Address to participants in the General Chapter of the Brothers of the Christian Schools, 21 May 2022). In this way the charism of the school, which you embrace with the fourth vow of teaching, besides being a service to society and a valuable work of charity, still appears today as one of the most beautiful and eloquent expressions of that priestly, prophetic and kinglymunuswe have all received in Baptism, as highlighted in the documents of theVatican Council II. Thus, in your educational entities, religious brothers make prophetically visible, through their consecration, the baptismal ministry that spurs everyone (cf. Dogmatic ConstitutionLumen Gentium, 44), each according to his or her status and duties, without differences, “as living members, to expend all their energy for the growth of the Church and its continuous sanctification” (ivi., 33). For this reason, I hope that vocations to Lasallian religious consecration may grow, that they may be encouraged and promoted, in your schools and outside them, and that, in synergy with all the other formative components, they may contribute to inspiring joyful and fruitful paths of holiness among the young people who attend them. Thank you for what you do! I pray for you, and I impart to you the apostolic Blessing, which I gladly extend to all the Lasallian Family.___________________ Holy See Press Office Bulletin, 15 May 2025 Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
2025,May,To participants in the Jubilee of the Oriental Churches (14 May 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/may/documents/20250514-giubileo-chiese-orientali.html,"ADDRESS OF THE HOLY FATHER LEO XIVTO PARTICIPANTS IN THE JUBILEE OF ORIENTAL CHURCHES Audience HallWednesday, 14 May 2025 [Multimedia] _________________________________ In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Peace be with you. Your Beatitudes, Your Eminence, Your Excellencies,Dear priests, consecrated men and women,Dear brothers and sisters, Christ is risen. He is truly risen!I greet you in these words that Eastern Christians in many lands never tire of repeating during the Easter season, as they profess the very heart of our faith and hope. It is very moving for me to see you here during the Jubilee of Hope, a hope unshakably grounded in the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Welcome to Rome! I am happy to be with you and to devote one of the first audiences of my pontificate to the Eastern faithful. You are precious in God’s eyes. Looking at you, I think of the diversity of your origins, your glorious history and the bitter sufferings that many of your communities have endured or continue to endure. I would like to reaffirm the conviction of Pope Francis that the Eastern Churches are to be “cherished and esteemed for the unique spiritual and sapiential traditions that they preserve, and for all that they have to say to us about the Christian life, synodality, and the liturgy. We think of early Fathers, the Councils, and monasticism… inestimable treasures for the Church (Address to Participants in the Meeting of Aid Agencies for the Oriental Churches [ROACO],27 June 2024). I would also like to mentionPope Leo XIII, the first Pope to devote a specific document to the dignity of your Churches, inspired above all by the fact that, in his words, “the work of human redemption began in the East” (cf. Apostolic LetterOrientalium Dignitas, 30 November 1894). Truly, you have “a unique and privileged role as the original setting where the Church was born” (SAINT JOHN PAUL II,Orientale Lumen, 5). It is significant that several of your liturgies – which you are now solemnly celebrating in Rome in accordance with your various traditions – continue to use the language of the Lord Jesus. Indeed,Pope Leo XIIImade a heartfelt appeal that the “legitimate variety of Eastern liturgy and discipline... may redound to the great honor and benefit of the Church” (Orientalium Dignitas). His desire remains ever timely. In our own day too, many of our Eastern brothers and sisters, including some of you, have been forced to flee their homelands because of war and persecution, instability and poverty, and risk losing not only their native lands, but also, when they reach the West, their religious identity. As a result, with the passing of generations, the priceless heritage of the Eastern Churches is being lost. Over a century ago,Leo XIIIpointed out that “preserving the Eastern rites is more important than is generally realized”. He went so far as to decree that “any Latin-Rite missionary, whether a member of the secular or regular clergy, who by advice or support draws any Eastern-Rite Catholic to the Latin Rite” ought to be “dismissed and removed from his office” (ibid). We willingly reiterate this appeal to preserve and promote the Christian East, especially in the diaspora. In addition to establishing Eastern circumscriptions wherever possible and opportune, there is a need to promote greater awareness among Latin Christians. In this regard, I ask the Dicastery for the Eastern Churches – which I thank for its work – to help me to define principles, norms, and guidelines whereby Latin Bishops can concretely support Eastern Catholics in the diaspora in their efforts to preserve their living traditions and thus, by their distinctive witness, to enrich the communities in which they live. The Church needs you. The contribution that the Christian East can offer us today is immense! We have great need to recover the sense of mystery that remains alive in your liturgies, liturgies that engage the human person in his or her entirety, that sing of the beauty of salvation and evoke a sense of wonder at how God’s majesty embraces our human frailty! It is likewise important to rediscover, especially in the Christian West, a sense of the primacy of God, the importance of mystagogy and the values so typical of Eastern spirituality: constant intercession, penance, fasting, and weeping for one’s own sins and for those of all humanity (penthos)! It is vital, then, that you preserve your traditions without attenuating them, for the sake perhaps of practicality or convenience, lest they be corrupted by the mentality of consumerism and utilitarianism. Your traditions of spirituality, ancient yet ever new, are medicinal. In them, the drama of human misery is combined with wonder at God’s mercy, so that our sinfulness does not lead to despair, but opens us to accepting the gracious gift of becoming creatures who are healed, divinized and raised to the heights of heaven. For this, we ought to give endless praise and thanks to the Lord. Together, we can pray with Saint Ephrem the Syrian and say to the Lord Jesus: “Glory to you, who laid your cross as a bridge over death… Glory to you who clothed yourself in the body of mortal man, and made it the source of life for all mortals” (Homily on our Lord, 9). We must ask, then, for the grace to see the certainty of Easter in every trial of life and not to lose heart, remembering, as another great Eastern Father wrote, that “the greatest sin is not to believe in the power of the Resurrection” (SAINT ISAAC OF NINEVEH,Sermones ascetici, I, 5). Who, better than you, can sing a song of hope even amid the abyss of violence? Who, better than you, who have experienced the horrors of war so closely thatPope Francisreferred to you as “martyr Churches” (Address to ROACO, ibid.)? From the Holy Land to Ukraine, from Lebanon to Syria, from the Middle East to Tigray and the Caucasus, how much violence do we see! Rising up from this horror, from the slaughter of so many young people, which ought to provoke outrage because lives are being sacrificed in the name of military conquest, there resounds an appeal: the appeal not so much of the Pope, but of Christ himself, who repeats: “Peace be with you!” (Jn20:19, 21, 26). And he adds: “Peace I leave you; my peace I give to you. I do not give it to you as the world gives it” (Jn14:27). Christ’s peace is not the sepulchral silence that reigns after conflict; it is not the fruit of oppression, but rather a gift that is meant for all, a gift that brings new life. Let us pray for this peace, which is reconciliation, forgiveness, and the courage to turn the page and start anew. For my part, I will make every effort so that this peace may prevail. The Holy See is always ready to help bring enemies together, face to face, to talk to one another, so that peoples everywhere may once more find hope and recover the dignity they deserve, the dignity of peace. The peoples of our world desire peace, and to their leaders I appeal with all my heart: Let us meet, let us talk, let us negotiate! War is never inevitable. Weapons can and must be silenced, for they do not resolve problems but only increase them. Those who make history are the peacemakers, not those who sow seeds of suffering. Our neighbours are not first our enemies, but our fellow human beings; not criminals to be hated, but other men and women with whom we can speak. Let us reject the Manichean notions so typical of that mindset of violence that divides the world into those who are good and those who are evil. The Church will never tire of repeating: let weapons be silenced. I would like to thank God for all those who, in silence, prayer and self-sacrifice, are sowing seeds of peace. I thank God for those Christians – Eastern and Latin alike – who, above all in the Middle East, persevere and remain in their homelands, resisting the temptation to abandon them. Christians must be given the opportunity, and not just in words, to remain in their native lands with all the rights needed for a secure existence. Please, let us strive for this! Thank you, dear brothers and sisters of the East, the lands where Jesus, the Sun of Justice, dawned, for being “lights in our world” (cf.Mt5:14). Continue to be outstanding for your faith, hope, and charity, and nothing else. May your Churches be exemplary, and may your Pastors promote communion with integrity, especially in the Synods of Bishops, that they may be places of fraternity and authentic co-responsibility. Ensure transparency in the administration of goods and be signs of humble and complete dedication to the holy people of God, without regard for honors, worldly power or appearance. Saint Symeon the New Theologian used an eloquent image in this regard: “Just as one who throws dust on the flame of a burning furnace extinguishes it, so the cares of this life and every kind of attachment to petty and worthless things destroy the warmth of the heart that was initially kindled” (Practical and Theological Chapters, 63). Today more than ever, the splendor of the Christian East demands freedom from all worldly attachments and from every tendency contrary to communion, in order to remain faithful in obedience and in evangelical witness. I thank you for this, and in cordially giving you my blessing, I ask you to pray for the Church and to raise your powerful prayers of intercession for my ministry. Thank you!

2025,May,Audience of the Holy Father Leo XIV to representatives of the media (12 May 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/may/documents/20250512-media.html,"ADDRESS OF THE HOLY FATHER LEO XIVTO REPRESENTATIVES OF THE MEDIA Audience HallMonday, 12 May 2025 [Multimedia] ___________________________________ Good morning and thank you for this wonderful reception! They say when they clap at the beginning it does not matter much, if you are still awake at the end and you still want to applaud…thank you very much! Brothers and sisters, I welcome you, representatives of the media from around the world. Thank you for the work you have done and continue to do in these days, which is truly a time of grace for the Church. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus proclaimed: “Blessed are the peacemakers” (Mt5:9). This is a Beatitude that challenges all of us, but it is particularly relevant to you, calling each one of you to strive for a different kind of communication, one that does not seek consensus at all costs, does not use aggressive words, does not follow the culture of competition and never separates the search for truth from the love with which we must humbly seek it.  Peace begins with each one of us: in the way we look at others, listen to others and speak about others. In this sense, the way we communicate is of fundamental importance: we must say “no” to the war of words and images, we must reject the paradigm of war. Let me, therefore, reiterate today the Church’s solidarity with journalists who are imprisoned for seeking to report the truth, and with these words I also ask for the release of these imprisoned journalists. The Church recognises in these witnesses – I am thinking of those who report on war even at the cost of their lives – the courage of those who defend dignity, justice and the right of people to be informed, because only informed individuals can make free choices. The suffering of these imprisoned journalists challenges the conscience of nations and the international community, calling on all of us to safeguard the precious gift of free speech and of the press. Thank you, dear friends, for your service to the truth. You have been in Rome these past few weeks to report on the Church, its diversity and, at the same time, its unity. You were present during the liturgies of Holy Week and then reported on the sorrow felt over the death of Pope Francis, which nevertheless took place in the light of Easter. That same Easter faith drew us into the spirit of the Conclave, during which you worked long and tiring days. Yet, even on this occasion, you managed to recount the beauty of Christ’s love that unites and makes us one people, guided by the Good Shepherd. We are living in times that are both difficult to navigate and to recount. They present a challenge for all of us but it is one that we should not run away from. On the contrary, they demand that each one of us, in our different roles and services, never give in to mediocrity. The Church must face the challenges posed by the times. In the same way, communication and journalism do not exist outside of time and history. Saint Augustine reminds of this when he said, “Let us live well and the times will be good. We are the times” (Discourse80.8). Thank you, therefore, for what you have done to move beyond stereotypes and clichés through which we often interpret Christian life and the life of the Church itself. Thank you because you have captured the essence of who we are and conveyed it to the whole world through every form of media possible. Today, one of the most important challenges is to promote communication that can bring us out of the “Tower of Babel” in which we sometimes find ourselves, out of the confusion of loveless languages that are often ideological or partisan. Therefore, your service, with the words you use and the style you adopt, is crucial. As you know, communication is not only the transmission of information, but it is also the creation of a culture, of human and digital environments that become spaces for dialogue and discussion. In looking at how technology is developing, this mission becomes ever more necessary. I am thinking in particular of artificial intelligence, with its immense potential, which nevertheless requires responsibility and discernment in order to ensure that it can be used for the good of all, so that it can benefit all of humanity. This responsibility concerns everyone in proportion to his or her age and role in society. Dear friends, we will get to know each other better over time. We have experienced – we can say together – truly special days. We have shared them through every form of media: TV, radio, internet, and social media. I sincerely hope that each of us can say that these days unveiled a little bit of the mystery of our humanity and left us with a desire for love and peace. For this reason, I repeat to you today the invitation made by Pope Francis in hismessage for this year’s World Day of Social Communications: let us disarm communication of all prejudice and resentment, fanaticism and even hatred; let us free it from aggression. We do not need loud, forceful communication, but rather communication that is capable of listening and of gathering the voices of the weak who have no voice. Let us disarm words and we will help to disarm the world. Disarmed and disarming communication allows us to share a different view of the world and to act in a manner consistent with our human dignity. You are at the forefront of reporting on conflicts and aspirations for peace, on situations of injustice and poverty, and on the silent work of so many people striving to create a better world. For this reason, I ask you to choose consciously and courageously the path of communication in favour of peace. Thank you all and may God bless you!

2025,May,Address of the Holy Father to the College of Cardinals (10 May 2025),https://www.vatican.va/content/leo-xiv/en/speeches/2025/may/documents/20250510-collegio-cardinalizio.html,"ADDRESS OF HIS HOLINESS POPE LEO XIVTO THE COLLEGE OF CARDINALS Saturday, 10 May 2025 [Multimedia]_______________ Thank you very much, Your Eminence. Before taking our seats, let us begin with a prayer, asking the Lord to continue to accompany this College, and above all the entire Church with this spirit, with enthusiasm, but also with deep faith. Let us pray together in Latin. Pater noster… Ave Maria… In the first part of this meeting, there will be a short talk with some reflections that I would like to share with you. But then there will be a second part, a bit like the opportunity that many of you had asked for: a sort of dialogue with the College of Cardinals to hear what advice, suggestions, proposals, concrete things, which have already been discussed in the days leading up to the Conclave. Dear Brother Cardinals, I greet all of you with gratitude for this meeting and for the days that preceded it. Days that were sad because of the loss of the Holy Father Pope Francis and demanding due to the responsibilities we confronted together, yet at the same time, in accordance with the promise Jesus himself made to us, days rich in grace and consolation in the Spirit (cf.Jn14:25-27). You, dear Cardinals, are the closest collaborators of the Pope. This has proved a great comfort to me in accepting a yoke clearly far beyond my own limited powers, as it would be for any of us. Your presence reminds me that the Lord, who has entrusted me with this mission, will not leave me alone in bearing its responsibility. I know, before all else, that I can always count on his help, the help of the Lord, and through his grace and providence, on your closeness and that of so many of our brothers and sisters throughout the world who believe in God, love the Church and support the Vicar of Christ by their prayers and good works. I thank the Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re – who deserves applause, at least once, if not more – whose wisdom, the fruit of a long life and many years of faithful service to the Apostolic See, has helped us greatly during this time. I thank the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell – I believe he is present today – for the important and demanding work that he has done throughout the period of the Vacant See and for the convocation of the Conclave. My thoughts also go to our brother Cardinals who, for reasons of health, were unable to be present, and I join you in embracing them in communion of affection and prayer. At this moment, both sad and joyful, providentially bathed in the light of Easter, I would like all of us to see the passing of our beloved Holy Father Pope Francis and the Conclave as a paschal event, a stage in that long exodus through which the Lord continues to guide us towards the fullness of life. In this perspective, we entrust to the “merciful Father and God of all consolation” (2 Cor1:3) the soul of the late Pontiff and also the future of the Church. Beginning with Saint Peter and up to myself, his unworthy Successor, the Pope has been a humble servant of God and of his brothers and sisters, and nothing more than this. It has been clearly seen in the example of so many of my Predecessors, and most recently by Pope Francis himself, with his example of complete dedication to service and to sober simplicity of life, his abandonment to God throughout his ministry and his serene trust at the moment of his return to the Father’s house. Let us take up this precious legacy and continue on the journey, inspired by the same hope that is born of faith. It is the Risen Lord, present among us, who protects and guides the Church, and continues to fill her with hope through the love “poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us” (Rom5:5). It is up to us to be docile listeners to his voice and faithful ministers of his plan of salvation, mindful that God loves to communicate himself, not in the roar of thunder and earthquakes, but in the “whisper of a gentle breeze” (1 Kings19:12) or, as some translate it, in a “sound of sheer silence.” It is this essential and important encounter to which we must guide and accompany all the holy People of God entrusted to our care. In these days, we have been able to see the beauty and feel the strength of this immense community, which with such affection and devotion has greeted and mourned its Shepherd, accompanying him with faith and prayer at the time of his final encounter with the Lord. We have seen the true grandeur of the Church, which is alive in the rich variety of her members in union with her one Head, Christ, “the shepherd and guardian” (1 Peter2:25) of our souls. She is the womb from which we were born and at the same time the flock (cf.Jn21:15-17), the field (cf.Mk4:1-20) entrusted to us to protect and cultivate, to nourish with the sacraments of salvation and to make fruitful by our sowing the seed of the Word, so that, steadfast in one accord and enthusiastic in mission, she may press forward, like the Israelites in the desert, in the shadow of the cloud and in the light of God’s fire (cf.Ex13:21). In this regard, I would like us to renew together today our complete commitment to the path that the universal Church has now followed for decades in the wake of theSecond Vatican Council. Pope Francis masterfully and concretely set it forth in the Apostolic ExhortationEvangelii Gaudium, from which I would like to highlight several fundamental points: the return to the primacy of Christ in proclamation (cf. No. 11); the missionary conversion of the entire Christian community (cf. No. 9); growth in collegiality and synodality (cf. No. 33); attention to thesensus fidei(cf. Nos. 119-120), especially in its most authentic and inclusive forms, such as popular piety (cf. No. 123); loving care for the least and the rejected (cf. No. 53); courageous and trusting dialogue with the contemporary world in its various components and realities (cf. No. 84; Second Vatican Council, Pastoral ConstitutionGaudium et Spes, 1-2). These are evangelical principles that have always inspired and guided the life and activity of God’s Family. In these values, the merciful face of the Father has been revealed and continues to be revealed in his incarnate Son, the ultimate hope of all who sincerely seek truth, justice, peace and fraternity (cf. Benedict XVI,Spe Salvi, 2; Francis,Spes Non Confundit, 3). Sensing myself called to continue in this same path, I chose to take the name Leo XIV. There are different reasons for this, but mainly because Pope Leo XIII in his historic EncyclicalRerum Novarumaddressed the social question in the context of the first great industrial revolution. In our own day, the Church offers to everyone the treasury of her social teaching in response to another industrial revolution and to developments in the field of artificial intelligence that pose new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labour. Dear brothers, I would like to conclude the first part of our meeting by making my own – and proposing to you as well – the hope that Saint Paul VI expressed at the inauguration of his Petrine Ministry in 1963: “May it pass over the whole world like a great flame of faith and love kindled in all men and women of good will. May it shed light on paths of mutual cooperation and bless humanity abundantly, now and always, with the very strength of God, without whose help nothing is valid, nothing is holy” (MessageQui Fausto Dieaddressed to the entire human family, 22 June 1963). May these also be our sentiments, to be translated into prayer and commitment, with the Lord’s help. Thank you! Copyright © Dicastero per la Comunicazione - Libreria Editrice Vaticana"
